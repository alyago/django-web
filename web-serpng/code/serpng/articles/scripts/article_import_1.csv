With experience and perseverance, you can pursue and land a job in sports. Here are five careers in the sports industry that are in demand.</p> <h3><b>Physical Therapist</b></h3> <p>For those who want to be involved with sports medicine, physical therapy is a good avenue. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that the job outlook for this profession is excellent. Many athletes sustain injuries, and its the job of the physical therapist to help the athlete manage pain and improve movement of the injured area. A masters degree and licensing is usually required.</p> <h3><b>Sports Psychologist</b></h3> <p>Many sports psychologists work directly with athletes to improve their mental health and emotional well-being. Psychologists help athletes with a wide range of issues, such as performance problems, stress reduction, injuries and coping skills. According to the BLS, the job outlook for psychologists will grow nearly 22 percent by 2020. Most psychologists need a master's degree; many also possess a doctorate.</p> <h3><b>Sports Agent</b></h3> <p>A sports agent represents professional athletes, marketing them to prospective teams, negotiating salaries and contracts and obtaining endorsement deals. Most agents handle all legal and financial issues related to managing the athlete. While some agents have no formal education in the field, aspiring agents often have a degree in sports management or sports business. There is a wider range of paths to becoming a sports agent than there are for other sports-related careers.</p> <h3><b>Public Relations Specialist</b></h3> <p>The public image of individual athletes and professional teams is important throughout the world of sports. Public relations (PR) specialists create media materials such as press releases to keep their clients in the spotlight while working with the media to maintain a positive public image for a team and its players. Many people who work in sports as a PR specialist have a degree in communications, journalism or business. The job outlook in the public relations field is strong.<b></b></p> <h3><b>Sports Merchandising</b></h3> <p>Selling sports merchandise is big business for both professional and collegiate athletic teams. The merchandise includes shirts, caps, sweatshirts, mugs and other paraphernalia that include the team's logo, mascot or name. Sales reps sell this merchandise at sporting events, in retail stores and online. A degree is often unnecessary to sell sports merchandise.</p> <h3><b>Getting a Job in Sports</b></h3> <p>It always helps to know someone. Work your network. Chances are you know at least one person who can make an introduction.</p><p>Another way to find a job in sports is by applying for jobs you find on job boards such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/a/jobs/list/q-sports"">Simply Hired</a>. These job boards offer a wide variety of openings in professional sports and other sports-related fields.</p> <p>If you are looking for a job you will be passionate about, take a look at careers in sports.You might find a field that truly interests you and allows you to work in professional sports.</p>"Career,5 Careers with Animals,"<h1>5 Careers with Animals</h1><p><a></a></p><p></p><p>If you love animals and would enjoy spending your days with them, a career working with animals might be perfect for you. There are hundreds of different jobs that involve working with animals. Here are five of them that allow you to work closely with animals every day.</p><h3>Animal Groomer</h3><p></p><p>Animal groomers clean, brush and trim animals' coats, clip their nails, brush their teeth and perform other grooming tasks. Groomers can specialize in household pets, such as dogs, or larger animals, such as horses. A pet groomer can learn the trade either through on-the-job training or by attending a state-licensed grooming school. Groomers work in grooming businesses, pet supply stores, kennels and stables.</p><p></p><p>Becoming an animal groomer is a also good job for someone who wants to own their own business or who has a rapport with both animals and people. In 2010, the median pay for animal care and service workers was $19,780 per year, and the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/"">annual job growth</a> for the next decade is expected to be greater than average.</p><h3>Animal Trainer</h3><p></p><p>If you have an affinity for a specific animal species, becoming an animal trainer allows you to use your ""animal-whisperer"" skills with your favorite animal. People most commonly train dogs or horses, but there are also trainers for marine animals, circus animals and TV and movie animals.</p><p></p><p><a></a>Dogs are trained for the widest variety of tasks. They provide security, assist people with disabilities and work as police dogs, search and rescue dogs and pet therapy animals. To become a trainer, you will need to complete training and acquire the certification of the governing body for your specialty. For example, dog trainers should be Certified Pet Dog Trainers, and service animal (working dog) trainers need extra training for their occupation.</p><h3>Wildlife Rehabilitator</h3><p></p><p>For those who want to help wild animals and birds, wildlife rehabilitation offers a rewarding career. For a job in this field, you should have at least a university degree in biology or ecology, and you must complete courses and seminars to learn how to care for wildlife and qualify for government-issued licenses and permits.</p><p></p><p>Job duties vary widely, and many require specialized skills. The <a href=""http://www.nwrawildlife.org/"">National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association</a>recently listed over 40 open jobs ranging from internships to executive director positions. Income depends on the type of job, but it is comparable to similar work in other nonprofit organizations.</p><h3>Veterinary Technician</h3><p></p><p>Veterinary technicians are a vital part of animal medicine and health. They work with veterinarians, performing medical tests and assisting in the treatment of ill or injured animals.</p><p></p><p>To become a veterinary technician, you need a two-year associate's degree in a post-secondary VT program. With a more advanced, four-year bachelor's degree you can become a veterinary technologist. VTs earned a median pay of $39,710 per year in 2010, and the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/"">job outlook</a> is excellent, with demand predicted to grow by 52 percent in the next 10 years.</p><h3>Veterinarian</h3><p></p><p>The profession of veterinarian is the highest paying one in animal care and also the one requiring the most education. To become a veterinarian, you must complete an accredited program at a college of veterinary medicine. Admission is competitive, and most applicants already have a bachelor's degree. After receiving a DVM, veterinarians can train in 40 different specialties. A veterinarian can expect to earn between $50,000 and $145,000 a year, depending on the type of practice. Interestingly, the lowest starting salary is for vets who work with horses, perhaps because these jobs take place outside of high-cost cities.</p><p></p><p>Careers with animals cover such a broad range of possibilities that anyone who loves working with animals and is motivated and educated should be able to build a satisfying future in this field.</p><p><a href=""http://www.nwrawildlife.org""></a></p>"Career,5 Successful People Who Started New Careers After 40,"<h1>5 Successful People Who Started New Careers After 40</h1><p>The phrase <i>""</i>It's never too late to teach an old dog new tricks"" isn't just something that pertains to our canine friends. It can be applied to people as well. If there is one thing at which people are capable, it is the ability to adapt. Using that ability, we can take on challenges that at first glance or thought would seem impossible. Flexibility can be put to use in just about any phase of life, but it is especially effective when considering new careers after 40. Here are some great examples of getting started in a new career later in life.</p><h3><b>Ronald Reagan</b> </h3><p>While most of us know Ronald Reagan from his time as president, he was also a fairly successful actor earlier in his life. He even served as president of the Screen Actors Guild. Reagan was 55 years old when he was elected to his first political office, becoming the Governor of California in 1966. Being the spokesman for General Electric, as well as an actor, might not seem like surefire ingredients for a two-term president, but it worked quite well in his case.</p><h3><b>Jack Cover</b></h3><p>Probably the least recognizable name on this list is Jack Cover. While his name might not jump out at you, chances are you know about his invention, the Taser. The early years of Cover's life are impressive; he was a nuclear physicist and worked in the fields of defense and aerospace, even helping his agency become one of the major contributors to NASA's Apollo space program. While Cover was busy in his early avionics career, he followed the news closely. He was compelled by stories of hijackings and invented a non-lethal weapon that is now used in more than 13,000 police and military installations and by nearly 185,000 people globally. Cover was 50 when he began his new career and his new company, Taser, Inc.</p><h3><b>Grandma Moses</b></h3><p>Ana Mary Robertson, more commonly known as Grandma Moses, was definitely a late bloomer. For most of her life, she enjoyed working on her Virginia farm, selling potato chips and embroidering intricate pictures as a hobby. Advancing age and arthritis caused her to retire to her daughter's home in her 80s, and it became difficult for her to hold embroidery needles without pain. Her sister suggested she try painting instead, and Robertson decided to channel her creative talents there. Good thing she picked up the paint brush because she became known as one of the greatest American folk artists, creating several well-known pieces of art and selling out art exhibitions around the country.</p><h3><b>Colonel Sanders</b></h3><p>While most people know the colonel as the head of Kentucky Fried Chicken, he also held many other jobs during his earlier life. After falsifying documents to join the United States Army at the age of 15, he went on to hold various other jobs including insurance salesman, firefighter for the railroad, steamboat pilot and even farmer. At the age of 40, he opened up a service station; he also cooked steaks, country ham and chicken dishes. With his reputation for good food growing, he moved to a 142-seat restaurant adjoining a motel, where he created the now-famous recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken. When the opening of a new interstate cut into his profits, he decided to take his show on the road and he started franchising KFC nationwide.</p><div><div><h3><b>Vera Wang</b></h3><p>Most people know Vera Wang as a famous fashion designer. Few people realize that Vera was once a talented figure skater, a career path that ended with her failure to make the U.S. Olympics team. She began a new career as an editor at Vogue magazine but was passed over for the position of editor-in-chief at the magazine. She then threw herself into her love of fashion. At the age of 40, she started designing wedding dresses and has become one of the most famous fashion designers of our time.</p><p>Use these people as inspiration for considering a new career after 40.

Try a Passive Job Search,"<p></p><div><h1><strong>Already Have a Job? Try a Passive Job Search</strong><br></h1><p></p></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><p></p><p>Even if you're content at your current job, it is always a good idea to keep an eye out for better positions. Doing so doesn't require much effort, and you never know what kinds of opportunities you will discover. Here are some tips to help you with your passive job search.<br></p> <h3>The Advantages of Passive Job Search</h3> <p>According to the human resources publication<a href=""http://www.tlnt.com/2011/03/08/survey-74-of-workers-are-passive-job-seekers-ready-to-consider-a-move/"">TLNT</a>, although the majority of workers in the U.S. claim to be satisfied with their jobs, research shows that about three quarters of them would switch jobs if a better opportunity came along. Common reasons for changing jobs include better pay and benefits, more advancement opportunities and a desire for change. <br></p> <p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2012/08/14/job-hopping-is-the-new-normal-for-millennials-three-ways-to-prevent-a-human-resource-nightmare/"">Forbes</a> reports that most Millennials, those who were born between 1977 and 1997, expect to stay at the same job for less than three years. They might go through 15 or more jobs throughout their lifetimes. Because job-hopping is becoming common, recruiters are beginning to see it as a sign of ambition among applicants who are not willing to settle for a job that doesn't leave them fulfilled.<br></p> <h3>How to Start Passively Look for a Job </h3> <p>Be discreet. You don't want to risk losing your current position by allowing your boss or co-workers to find out about your job search. For this reason, any activities you conduct should be anonymous. Websites like <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> make it easy for you to set up e-mail job alerts for one or many positions. Just be sure to check these emails at home or on your personal cell phone.</p><p></p><p> </p><h3>Use Social Media for Your Search <br></h3> <p>As you wait for the right position to open, you should track companies you would love to work for. Reading their social media updates can give you some insight into the company, including whether there are job openings. Just remember not to show your interest publicly, such as by commenting on job listings, since your current employer could see it. <br></p> <p>In addition, the<a href=""http://www.careereducation.columbia.edu/resources/tipsheets/finding-job-using-social-media-intro"">Columbia University Center for Career Education</a> recommends that you keep your social media profiles updated at all times. This is an effective method for catching the eye of recruiters. And this way, you do not have to scramble to update your information once your passive job search begins, which could tip off your current employer. <br></p> <h3>Take Advantage of Anonymous Settings on Job Boards <br></h3> <p>One of the easiest ways to search passively is to post your resume on job boards. This only requires a few minutes of your time, and it could lead to a company finding you. Of course, make sure your resume cannot be seen by the public. Private settings on job boards remove your name and other identifying information, ensuring that recruiters only see your skills and experience before contacting you through the board to learn more. <br></p> <h3>Network with People You Know <br></h3> <p>One final tip: leverage your network of professional contacts and acquaintances during your passive job search. Of course, your coworkers and boss should be exempt from this group. But if you have friends who often rave about their jobs, there's no harm in asking them to let you know each time their company is hiring. Also, if you belong to an alumni association or a professional group for people in your industry, simply staying in touch and discussing careers is an easy way to hear about the latest job openings.</p>"Interviews,Avoid Saying These Words During Job Interviews,"<h1>Avoid Saying These Words During Job Interviews</h1><p>If you're not acing your job interviews, the words you use could be part of the problem. Fortunately for you, something like your vocabulary is fairly easy to fix. Here are eight words you should avoid during interviews and why. <br></p> <p><b>1. Try </b></p> <p><a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/passive-aggressive-diaries/201005/passive-aggressive-words-in-the-workplace"">Psychology Today</a> calls this word a passive aggressive term that you should not use in any field. It can suggest that you do not plan to give a particular task all of your effort, which won't impress many interviewers. Using this word can also indicate that you lack passion, since it is noncommittal. <br></p> <p><b>2. Maybe </b></p> <p>This is another noncommittal word. It doesn't display any confidence in your ability to make a decision or complete a task. <br></p> <p><b>3. Grueling </b></p> <p>Even if you are describing a difficult project at your last job, or are somehow putting this word into a positive context, it probably won't help you win favor with interviewers. That's because, according to <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/6285-words-hurt.html"">Live Science</a>, studies show that the brain has a negative reaction to words that describe pain. In fact, such terms can bring on memories of painful experiences in others. This is not how you want your interviewer to remember you. So be sure to stay away from ""grueling,"" ""tormenting,"" ""torture"" and similar words that run the risk of triggering bad associations.</p> <p><b>4. Fired </b></p> <p>Studies show that the brain remembers bad things more clearly than good things. When you bring up words with negative connotations, including ""fired"" or ""terminated,"" it could leave a bad impression with interviewers since they will remember the negative things you said more than the positive. <br></p> <p><b>5. Workaholic </b></p> <p>You might assume that being a workaholic is appealing to employers, but <a href=""http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2013/05/10/classic-interview-mistakes/"">Fortune</a> reports that it could indicate that you do not know how to prioritize. If you have to work overtime on a consistent basis just to get the job done, you might not be very effective at work during regular hours. Plus, not all employers want someone chained to the desk; many want you to be well-rounded as a person. <br></p> <p><b>6. We </b></p> <p>Try to avoid using this word much, if at all. You might want to show that you can work well in a team, but according to <a href=""http://blog.chron.com/careerrescue/2012/11/dont-say-that-phrases-to-avoid-during-an-interview/"">The Houston Chronicle</a>, emphasizing this word might give the impression that you cannot work on projects alone. Remember that you are the one in the interview, not your coworkers, so focus on what you in particular can bring to the table. <br></p> <p><b>7. Innovative </b></p> <p>It can be tempting to use this adjective to describe yourself, especially when you're interviewing for a company that encourages creativity and outside-the-box thinking. This is just one of many overused buzzwords that employers are tired of hearing. Similar words to avoid include ""motivated,"" ""entrepreneurial"" and ""dynamic."" <br></p> <p><b>8. Impossible </b></p> <p>This word can indicate that you are not willing to rise to the challenge to get something done. In fact, <a href=""http://blog.grantham.edu/blog/bid/143814/5-Words-to-Erase-from-Your-Vocabulary-in-Job-Interviews"">Grantham University</a> reports that it can make you come off as lazy or unwilling to work to meet a goal. As you'll find in all job interviews you go to, employers are not interested in hiring job applicants who give up before they even get started on a task. </p><p>Steer clear of the above words on your job interviews and you will leave a much better impression and increase your chances of getting hired.</p>"Career,Careers: Taste Tester,"<h2>Careers: Taste Tester</h2><p></p><p>The life of a professional taste tester is an enviable one. Who doesn't dream of trying out new foods and drinks on a regular basis and getting paid for their opinion? To be hired as a taste tester in the food industry, you don't need a university degree or specific training; however, if you do have the right education or training, you will go to the top of the resume pile. Careers in this industry are highly coveted.</p><p> All food and beverage testing facilities need testers to ensure not only that their products are palatable, but that they are consistent. According to <a href=""http://www.today.com/food/truth-about-being-taste-tester-its-not-always-tasty-1C8427211"">Today Food</a>, developing a finely-tuned palette that is capable of discerning the slight differences from one batch of coffee-flavored ice cream to the next is important for would-be professional taste testers. Such a palette and the ability to communicate easily with product developers are the most important qualities of a taste tester. Specific qualifications vary between employers, but there are a few characteristics that will appeal to employers looking for food and beverage testers.</p><p></p><h3><b>Top Qualifications of a Taste Tester</b></h3><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Food service experience<br></li><li>Food science degree<br></li><li>Strong sensory abilities</li><li>Flexible schedule<br></li><li>Detail-oriented<br></li><li>Outgoing personality<br></li></ul><p></p><p>Experience as a cook, a chef or even a waiter can make you more appealing to food industry employers because they will know you have certain knowledge of the way food is prepared. In addition to these qualifications, education in food science is a bonus for anyone looking for careers in taste-testing.</p><p>Food science courses teach you about the biology of natural foods as well as the chemical properties of natural and processed foods. Armed with this knowledge, educated job applicants are more likely to be hired as food testers because they will already understand key concepts. However, they will still be tested for their sensory ability, which is a crucial qualification of the job.</p><h3><b>On-Site Training</b></h3><p></p><p>Being hired as a taste tester is not contingent on holding a degree. What matters is a passion and drive to succeed, as well as a finely-tuned sensory ability. If an applicant has those, they stand a good chance of finding a job testing food and beverages. In many cases, employers will pick applicants that best meet their job requirements and offer them on-site training.</p><h3><b>Taste-Testing Testimony</b></h3><p> <a href=""http://flavorman.com/the-perks-and-quirks-of-a-professional-taste-tester/"">Kristen Wemer</a> is a professional taste tester who started working in the industry during college. ""Ive been able to parlay my passion for flavors into a career where companies actually pay me money to taste and evaluate various items.<em>Think dream job!</em>I began as an intern tasting oils. Next, I climbed a level in the food pyramid to a stint tasting milk in the quality lab of a dairy. Ok, so dream job is relevant, but it gets better.""</p><p>Wemer started small and worked her way into a full-time position tasting various types of products as part of quality control. She loves her job, but says there are some days she will never forget when a poor-quality product touched her taste buds. Despite the drawbacks of testing products that should never see a grocery store shelf, Wemer finds her job stimulating and in tune with her creativity and culinary appetite.<br></p><h3><b>Salary of a Taste Tester</b></h3><p>Training programs for these careers will likely be paid, and afterwards result in part or half-time employment as is needed by the company. Because the senses become fatigued, a taste tester generally works no more than two hours at a time. <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/01/13/professional-tasters-eat-and-drink-for-living/"">Fox News</a> reports that entry-level taste testers make between $30,000 and $60,000 a year. Not bad for a job that involves eating!</p>"Career,Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Security Jobs,"<h1>Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Security Jobs</h1><p>Security jobs can be a personally rewarding way to make a living. As a security guard, you might help keep others safe or guard a place that's important to a community. If you're interested in security jobs, here's a primer to get you started.</p><h3>Security Jobs Qualifications</h3><p>The qualifications you need to work as a security guard vary by state, employer and whether you are armed or unarmed.</p><p>These examples will help you better understand the qualifications.</p><p>If you want to work as a security guard in the state of <a href=""http://www.bsis.ca.gov/forms_pubs/guard_fact.shtml"">California</a>, you need:</p><ul><li>A valid security guard registration</li><li>A valid photo ID</li><li>To be 18 years or older</li><li>To pass a background check</li><li>To complete 40 hours of required training</li><li>To pass an exam to become certified</li></ul><p>The State of <a href="" http://www.tn.gov/regboards/pps/usgoReqs.shtml"">Tennessees</a> requirements are a bit more thorough.</p><ul><li>Be 18 years or older</li><li>Be legal to work in the U.S</li><li>Be mentally competent</li><li>Be of good moral character</li><li>Be free of chemical addiction</li><li>Be physically able to perform your duties</li><li>Be free of convictions involving firearms, shoplifting and violence</li><li>Submit to a background check</li><li>Meet training requirements, including a four-hour basic course and one-hour courses in orientation, legal powers and limitations of a security guard/officer, emergency procedures and general duties</li></ul><p>You may also need special training in order to carry a firearm, which will increase your opportunities for advancement and your wages.</p><h3>The Risks</h3><p><a></a>Being a security guard comes with risk.

These statistics do fluctuate slightly. For example, 2006 only saw 8.7 fatalities per 100,000 security guards. However, there are consistently higher rates of homicide deaths among security guards than in the average workforce population.</p><p>This shouldnt be surprising considering that organizations hire security guards to protect their workers, their property and their customers. Security guards are hired to face danger. This is why security guards also receive training, equipment and support to help them keep themselves and others safe. Proper training and conscientious performance can reduce the risk of workplace injury or death.</p><h3>The Pay</h3><p>The <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes339032.htm"">median hourly wage for security guards working in the U.S.</a> is $11.52 per hour or $23,970 per year. That can vary, ranging as low as $8.36 per hour or $17,390 per year to as high as $20.43 per hour or $42,490 per year. There are over one million security guards working across the country, and it is viewed as a good job for physically able men and women who are willing to take risks in order to help keep others safe.</p><p></p>"Interviews,Government Jobs that Pay Well,"<h1><b>5 Government Jobs that Pay Well</b></h1> <p>While jobs in the private sector often pay well, the recession and layoffs have led some workers into lower-paying jobs that were not part of their career plans. For those willing to look at a new career plane, government jobs offer stability and pay that are competitive and often top the private sector.</p><p>More than 21 million people work for the U.S. federal, state and local government, including government-owned schools and hospitals and the U.S. Postal Service.

Hiring employers sift through cover letters when searching for the right candidate, and you want to be one of the few who leaves an impression. Most employers will just scan the first few lines of your cover letter, and if nothing grabs them right away, it's likely they will move on to the next application.</p> <p>Your opening line should be good. It has to show the hiring employer why you are the right person for the job and also keep him or her interested. <a href=""http://careergirlnetwork.com/4-cover-letter-openers-that-score-the-interview/?goback=%2Egde_3135001_member_227615972#%21"">Marcy Twete, author of <i>You Know Everybody!

However, one of the most repeated claims in recent years is that the average worker will have seven different jobs in his or her lifetime.</p><p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704206804575468162805877990"">How exactly the number seven gained traction remains a mystery</a>. Some job experts and economists claim that such a high number is implausible, but there are workers who have changed jobs that many times or more, so it's not impossible. Millennials are known for changing jobs quite frequently.</p><p>The Millennial generation includes those people born between 1977 and 1997. According to a <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2012/08/14/job-hopping-is-the-new-normal-for-millennials-three-ways-to-prevent-a-human-resource-nightmare/"">survey by Future Workplace</a> entitled ""Multiple Generations at Work,"" 91 percent of Millennials expect to stay at a job for less than three years. With that figure, Millennials will experience about 15 to 20 career changes in a lifetime.To think, job researchers and economists think that<i>seven</i>job changes in a career is considered high.<br></p><h3>Nothing New</h3><p></p><p>It sounds like a new trend, but early and frequent job changes have always been common. Most people do not stay at the same job they had in high school for their entire lives, or remain in their college jobs, and many don't remain at their first post-college, entry-level position for a lifetime.</p><p>Even the Baby Boomers shopped around settling down at a particular position or company. It often takes more than one or two jobs before a person finds solid footing in the workforce. Statistics from the Labor Department, however, suggest the amount of time American adults have spent with the same employer hasnt changed much over the years:</p><p></p><ul><li>In 1996, 9 percent of workers had been with their employer for 20 years or more. In 2008, 10.3 percent of workers had been with the same employer for at least 20 years.</li><li>In 1996, the average workers tenure with his or her current employer was 3.8 years. In 2000, that number had dropped slightly to 3.5 years; but by 2008, it had risen to 4.1 years.</li></ul><p></p><p><a></a>The statistics from 2008 represent the latest available data, so take these stats with a small grain of salt. The workscape changed dramatically with the 2008 recession and its aftermath.</p><p></p><h3><b>What Can You Do to Be Prepared for Job Changes?</b></h3><p></p><p>If job hopping is the norm, then job seekers need to be versatile. Workers must adapt to the changing workforce. It's no longer just a question of going to college to become better prepared for a particular job; it's the realization that you may need to go back to school again, learn a trade or get an alternative certificate later in your career. After all, it's always good to keep one's options open regarding opportunities that may present themselves. Remain flexible and diversified if you feel there are other outlets for you to explore professionally.</p><p></p><p>The American author F. Scott Fitzgerald famously said, ""There are no second acts in American lives."" Not so, F. Scott. Apparently there are seven acts, and what's considered a normal number of job changes in a career is only going to keep changing.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Interviews,How to Answer 'Tell Me More About Yourself',"<h1><b>How To Answer 'Tell Me More About Yourself' in a Job Interview</b></h1><p></p><p></p><p>You might dread it, but when the ""tell me more about yourself"" question is asked during a job interview, it's an opportunity to shine. The question comes up in most interviews, and you don't want to answer it slack-jawed; it's well worth the time to prepare for this moment.<br></p><p>Sometimes the interviewer will start the interview with this question. Otherwise the question will arrive later. It is used to gauge how applicants see themselves, to pull the kind of information that wouldn't be received from a direct question and, perhaps above all, to see if the candidates are actually prepared.</p><p></p><p>If you do prepare, this shouldn't be a difficult question for you. According to Marc Cenedella of TheLadders, who used to conduct hiring interviews, <a href=""http://www.theladders.com/career-advice/how-to-answer-tell-me-about-yourself-interview-question"">the worst response is to ask back, ""What do you want to know?""</a>This shows that you didn't expect the question and might not be serious about the job.</p><p></p><p>Prepare an answer and practice it until it sounds good. Your answer should focus on making your personality and your skills look like a good match for the company.</p><p>Here are some more suggestions for answering the ""Tell me more about yourself"" interview question.<br></p><h3><b>Avoid sharing mundane personal information</b></h3>The interviewer doesn't really care about where you were born or grew up. When you are asked to tell the interviewer about yourself, you're not being asked about your demographics. He or she wants to learn more about your professional experience. How can you benefit the company? What makes you qualified and able to do the job? What makes you different?<br><h3><b>Begin with credentials</b></h3>These aspects of your life are simpler and easier to remember and can help get the ball rolling. Practically anything you say will sound better with your official accreditation right at the front.<br><h3><b>Highlight your most memorable achievements</b></h3>Take the time beforehand to study up on yourself, and pinpoint the times when you have shown leadership, confidence, a good work ethic, the ability to work under pressure and other relevant workplace scenarios.<br><h3><b>Don't ramble</b></h3>Say what you planned to say, and don't include the too-personal details you would tell your friends. It's OK to take a moment to think; but don't create a long, awkward silence. Don't go on and on either. When you're done, you're done. About one minute is a good length of time for a response.<br><h3><b>Explain why you are interested in the job</b></h3>In all likelihood, many people can do the job for which you are applying. The interviewer wants to know how you are different from the other candidates, and <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/04/30/how-to-answer-tell-me-about-yourself-in-a-job-interview"">a good way to approach this is to talk about why you personally are interested in this career</a>. Find a way to make your interests fit the job position, if needs be, and never give the impression that you are just doing it for the money.<br><h3><b>Tell a story</b></h3>Stories help to explain your motivations and showcase your abilities in a real-life scenario. They also engage the interviewer personally and get them interested in what you are talking about. Even if you have no work experience that is directly relevant to the job, you can still tell a story about how you overcame a particularly challenging problem, led a group of people successfully or had a major positive impact on a company.<br><h3><b>Avoid cliches</b></h3>The interviewer knows all the buzzwords that applicants use to describe themselvesbetter than the applicants do. <a href=""http://jobs.theguardian.com/article/4170846/common-interview-questions/"">Many words sound trite and rehearsed</a>, as if the applicant has a list of them ready to go, and the interviewer has heard these phrases many times, which is why their eyes are glossing over. Don't say things like, ""I'm a team player,"" ""I have a strong work ethic"" or ""I follow instructions well and can work independently."" Instead, demonstrate these qualities by telling stories and providing personal examples.<p></p><p>The next time you are asked to ""tell me more about yourself"", you know what to do. Share your credentials, demonstrate your abilities and interests and explain what you have achieved in the past.</p>"Interviews,How to End a Job Interview on a Positive Note,"<h1>How to End a Job Interview on a Positive Note</h1><p>You've submitted your resume and cover letter and have been called for a job interview. If you're like most applicants, you're at least a little nervous about the interview. Here's a tip that might help. Finish up strong. End the interview on a positive note to maximize your first impression. As they say in showbiz, leave 'em wanting more.</p><h3>Show Off What You Know About the Company</h3><div>One thing that interviewing managers love is a candidate who has done their research. The moment you receive notice about an interview, intensify your research in the company. This means going online and reading the company website. Start with the ""About the Company"" and ""News"" sections. Jot down important facts, such as when the company was organized, how big it is, what it does, what its goals and motto are and what news it has announced publicly. Make sure to bring this up in the interview when it is natural to do so.<br><br></div><div>If at the end of the interview you're asked the question, ""What can you bring to our company?"" or ""Why should we hire you over another candidate?"" work some of the company's own information into your answer. For example, if the company has earned an award for Best Software Sales Team, you could say something about your hard work and your belief that you can use your skills and dedication to help attain the Best Software Sales Team award next year.</div><h3>Ask a Good Question</h3><div>Sometimes the interviewing manager will ask if you have any questions at the end of the interview. The <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/jobs/features/2007/interview-survival-kit/finish_strong.html""><i>Washington Post</i></a> recommends asking away. Use this as an opportunity to win over the interviewer. You can ask a basic question such as, ""What's a typical workday like?""This not only highlights your interest in the job, but it also shows interest in the company.</div><div></div><div><a href=""https://www.devex.com/en/news/finish-strong-how-to-end-a-job-interview-on-a-positive-note/76854"">Devex</a>recommends asking questions that show you've done your research on the company. An example Devex provided for guidance is: ""I noticed in your annual report that fundraised income increased by 11 percent last year and it was private donations as opposed to large corporate sponsorship that drove this change. Can you tell me more about that?"" A hiring manager is going to love you at this moment.<br></div><h3>Discuss Your Skills After the Interview</h3><div>As the end of the interview draws near, remind the interviewer of your skills. This way your skills will be fresh in their memory. Here's one way you can integrate this information into the closing conversation:</div><div></div><div>If you're asked, ""Do you have anything you wish to add before we conclude?"" Answer with, "" Yes, do you feel my skills in _____ and _____ would make me a successful candidate for the interview?""<br></div><div><br></div><div>Now, you may be nervous about asking this question, but it's surprising useful. Not only is it a good way to remind the interviewer of your skills, but it also shows that you really care about getting the job. Bonus: You'll gain some insight into what the company is thinking and whether you have a shot.<br></div><div><h3>Close with Good Etiquette</h3><div>In addition to addressing the interviewer using formal salutations, always end the interview politely. Allow the interviewer to stand up before you do. Make eye contact. Shake hands. The <a href=""http://work.chron.com/end-job-interviews-17223.html"">HoustonChronicle</a>recommends saying ""thank you for considering me"" at the end of the interview.</div><div><br></div><div>And don't forget the all-important thank-you note:<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2013/08/26/job-seekers-no-the-interview-thank-you-note-is-not-dead/"">Forbes</a> says that a company is 22 percentless likely to hire a person who doesn't send a thank you letter. The business publicationrecommends including the following in a thank you letter:<br></div></div><div><br></div><div><ul><li>The hiring managers name</li><li>The title of the open position</li><li>Something specific about the interview or important items discussed</li><li>Your interest in the position</li><li>Your appreciation for their time (the ""thank you"" part)</li><li>Your recognition of the next steps in the hiring process</li><li>Your contact information</li></ul><div>Experts recommend sending it within 24 hours by email or post.</div></div><div><br>There you have it. You don't have to put on a show to end your interview on a positive note. Just pay attention, ask questions related to the business, include your interviewer and be cordial and polite. Good luck!</div>"Job Search Tips,How to Keep Your Job Search Secret,"<h1><b>5 Tips for Keeping Your Job Search Secret from Your Boss</b></h1> <p>The best time to look for a job is when you already have one, but keeping your job search a secret can be a tricky endeavor. Here are five tips for ensuring your current employer is none the wiser until you give your two weeks notice.</p> <h3><b>Radio Silence on Social Media</b></h3> <p>Avoid talking about your search on any of your social networking sites, even those that are (seemingly) private. If a friend on Facebook comments on your post, people in their network, even those who are not friends with you, can see that update. Of course, that doesn't mean you can't use social media at all in your search. As Fauzia Burke outlined in the Huffington Post, there are still plenty of<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fauzia-burke/linkedin-tips_b_2238000.html"">ways to be effective on LinkedIn</a>. Just go to ""Privacy & Settings,"" click on ""Turn on/off your activity broadcasts,"" and make sure the box is unchecked. That way, none of your connections, including coworkers, will see updates or changes to your profile in their feeds.</p> <h3><b>Only on Your Own Time</b></h3> <p>It might go without saying, but it needs to be said: don't job search on your current company's time. Not only is it risky, but it's disrespectful. Not concerned that your current company will care? Potential employers might, and they're wary of candidates who use company resources while applying for positions. It looks inappropriate and unprofessional from the outside and will call your integrity into question.</p> <h3><b>Don't Call Off Sick</b></h3> <p>Continually calling off sick looks suspicious and will also have the adverse effect of making you look unreliable in your current position. Whenever possible, do your best to schedule interviews in your off-work hours, or request time off if necessary. It makes your absence look more official and less like you're being irresponsible.</p> <h3><b>Dress Normally</b></h3> <p>If you have you an interview scheduled after work, don't dress any differently. Coming to work in a suit when you usually wear casual clothes is a clear sign that you're on the job hunt. As<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/10/26/the-dos-and-donts-of-job-searching-while-youre-still-employed/2/"">Andy Teach suggests over at Forbes</a>, bring your interview clothes with you, but keep them in your car. Don't drive to work? Take your suit to a dry cleaner nearby several days prior (a clean suit certainly can't hurt your chances), and give yourself time to pick it up and change before the interview.</p> <h3><b>Avoid Lying Whenever Possible</b></h3> <p>Don't make up stories about absences or your changed behavior at work. Just quietly ask for the time off, and avoid providing any details regarding the request. It's all right to tell a suspicious manager that you're just ""attending to a personal issue"" or taking a ""personal day,"" as<a href=""http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/03/how-to-keep-a-job-search-discr/"">Amy Gallo at the Harvard Business Review suggests</a>. As long as your employer doesn't ask you directly whether you're job searching, vague responses are an acceptable way to maintain secrecy without making you a liar.</p> <h3><b>Bonus Tip: Leave on Good Terms</b></h3> <p>No matter how you feel about your current situation, you always want to leave a job on the best possible terms. Keeping your job search secret may feel disingenuous, but broadcasting your intention to leave is worse. Quietly going about your job hunt is more respectful, as well as giving at least two weeks notice. Maintain good relationships at your current company at all costs, if only so you'll have reliable references in a future job search.</p> <p></p>"Job Search Tips,How to Land a Dream Job at Your Dream Company,"<h1><b>7 Ways to Land a Dream Job at Your Dream Company</b></h1> <p>You have identified your dream job and your dream company, but what comes next? Is there a surefire way to get noticed, beat the competition and maneuver yourself straight into your coveted position?You bet there is. Pursuing your dream job is something people do, and succeed at, every day. Here are some tips on how to let a company you want to work for know that youre interested and available:</p> <ol><li><b>""Stalk"" the company in a good, productive way</b>.Find out everything you can about its history, achievements, goals and culture. Also, learn about current and former company executives. This information may help you survive once you get in the door. <br></li><li><b>Network incessantly until you can find an entrance into the companys corporate family</b>. You can do this by asking friends, acquaintances or industry professionals for introductions and also by showing up at events where the company will have a presence.</li><li><b>Use social media to find out about upcoming jobs and telegraph your availability</b>. A great many job openings are shared on social media and in-group LinkedIn posts. Not only that, but <a href=""http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/02/07/insider-tips-how-to-use-linkedin-to-find-job/"">Fox Business</a> reports that employers are increasingly turning to LinkedIn to find candidates for their job openings. So make sure that you have a professional, up-to-date profile on LinkedIn and have uploaded your resume to <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>.</li><li><b>Show up at relevant job fairs</b>. These events can be ideal for clearing the first hurdle and getting yourself noticed.According to the investment firm<a href=""http://www.aboutschwab.com/blog/snag_your_dream_job_a_recruiters_top_10_tips_to_work_a_job_fair"">Charles Schwab</a>you should make sure you prepare firstby dressing as professionally as you can, and bring several hard copies of your resume and cover letter. In addition, it is better to show up later rather than earlier because people tend to treat job fairs like after-Thanksgiving sales, lining up in the wee small hours and rushing through the doors. By arriving during the last few hours of the fair, you might have more individual time with the company recruiters you most want to see.</li><li><b>If have a job, dont criticize it; otherwise, youll sound like a disgruntled employee</b>. Instead, indicate that everythings fine where you are, and you consider your dream company to represent the holy grail of career opportunities. Be subtle, but be suitably enthusiastic as well. By impressing those in power (on as many occasions as possible), there may come a time when theyll remember you with equal enthusiasm when a position comes open.</li><li><b>St</b><b>rictly follow the companys hiring protocol</b>. Many corporations maintain sophisticated tracking systems for their applicants, and you can keep yourself in the loop by constantly updating your information and setting yourself up for alerts when new positions open up. Also, use keywords to set up a<a href=""http://www.google.com/alerts"">Google alert</a>for whenever your dream company is in the news, especially as it concerns hiring.</li><li><b>Subscribe to newsletters, forums, websites and anything else that will bring you news about your dream company</b>. Check regularly with job boards such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>, and sign up for email alerts,to find out if any openings have been posted.</li></ol> <p>By methodically ""stalking"" your company and being ready as soon as that corporate door opens a crack, youll be in a good position to get to the head of the line when it comes to winning your dream job.</p><p><br></p> <p></p> <p></p>"Interviews,How to Project Confidence During a Job Interview,"<h1><b>How to Project Confidence During a Job Interview</b><br></h1><p>A job interview can be a tense, intimidating experience, but there are ways to improve your chances of landing the position. To increase your chances of getting a call-back or an on-the-spot offer, calm your nerves like a Zen master, focus on the task at hand and project confidence.</p><p>How you present yourself, the questions you ask and the manner in which you ask questions go a long way towards determining what sort of impression you will make on a potential employer. If the first five minutes you spend with someone determines how far a relationship goes, then you need to learn how to project confidence during a job interview.<br></p><p></p><h3><b>1. When it comes to appearance, stick to the classics</b></h3><p></p><p>Appearing poised and controlled gives you self-confidence. Take the necessary steps to go above and beyond simply looking good. A job interview isn't the time to gamble on your appearance, so stick to the classics. For example, a no-iron, button-down dress shirt is the type of business attire you should wear, not the Hawaiian shirt you got while on vacation in Cancun. </p><p></p><h3><b>2. Talk slowly and clearly, and get to the point</b></h3><p></p><p>How you answer questions is just as important as what you say. If you are nervous, you may have a tendency to talk too fast. Make a conscious effort to slow down. Long-winded answers not only illustrate nervousness and anxiety, they also demonstrate poor communication skills. Keep your answers succinct and concise.</p><p></p><h3><b>3. Arrogance is not confidence</b></h3><p></p><p>When you're face-to-face with a potential employer, you don't want to come across as arrogant, boastful or pompous. Relay your skills, talents and previous work experiences in a humble and matter-of-fact manner. Gloating about your past achievements or promotions is off-putting. Real confidence does not draw attention to itself. </p><p></p><h3><b>4. Fidgeting draws negative attention, so calm the hands</b></h3><p></p><p>Good body language is key to demonstrating confidence. Fidgeting, touching your face and fiddling with your clothing are nervous tics you need to leave at the door. There's nothing calm, cool or collected about playing with your hair or continually adjusting your tie. So what are you supposed to do to calm your hands? Imagine there's an invisible line (or a sort of mental electric fence) somewhere on your torso, and try to keep your hands below it.</p><p></p><h3><b>5.</b> <b>Do your homework</b></h3><p></p><p><a></a>The more you know about the company or business you're interviewing for, the better you can tailor your answers. This type of knowledge will give you a boost of confidence. The interviewer is going to be impressed that you've taken the time to research the company and its products and services. It shows initiative and hits home the fact you're willing to go the extra mile. </p><p></p><h3><b>6. </b><b>Steer clear of clichs</b></h3><p></p><p>Answering questions on the spot can be nerve-wracking; but the last thing you want is to pepper your responses with a lot of ""likes"" or ""ums."" At the same time, you don't want to fall back on clichs either. Interviewers don't want to hear how you're a team player or a people person. Employers hear those tired phrases at every interview they conduct. Creativity shows confidence, so set yourself apart from other candidates by being original in your responses. </p><p>Ask your friends or family for advice. Any help from others who have been there before can be useful. Follow these six tips and you'll portray the confidence to ace that next job interview.</p>"Interviews,How to Speak Slowly During a Job Interview,"<h1><strong>How to Speak Slowly During a Job Interview</strong></h1><b> </b><p align=""center""></p><b> </b><p>Job interviews can be nerve-wracking. Most of us, when we are nervous, tend to speak faster.Speaking too quickly can hurt your chances of getting a job because it's not the ideal way to sell yourself.</p><p>Hiring managers want candidates who are confident and communicate clearly, as the candidates will be expected to do with customers and coworkers on the job. While everyone understands that it is normal to be nervous during an interview, it is how you handle your nerves that determines how you are perceived. Learn to speak slower during your job interviews by following these three tips.</p> <p></p> <h3><b>1. Practice by Timing Your Rate of Speech</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>Before you attend an interview, sit down and run through a mock interview. If possible, get a friend to help. Have them time you while you are speaking. The average rate of a typical speaker is around 130 to 150 words per minute. Because it can be difficult to gauge time on the fly, read from a prepared sheet of paper that has at least 300 words on it. If you finish that paper or come close to finishing it in a minute, you are speaking too quickly. This will help you gauge whether you speak fast and give you a guideline of where you need to be. Practice reading at the correct pace to help you train your brain for slower speech.</p> <p><b></b></p> <h3><b>2. Learn to Listen</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>If you find yourself forming a response while the interviewer is speaking, this could lead to you rushing once its your turn to speak, and it could also mean that you are not listening effectively. It is important to learn how to listen to the interviewer. They will appreciate the attentiveness, and you wont feel as rushed when it is your time to talk. A pause that forces you to listen all the way through an interviewer's questioncan be useful, especially if the interviewer refers back to something that was said earlier. This technique is used to determine how well you were paying attention. If you were busy thinking about what you were going to say next, chances are you didn't hear what the interviewer had to say.</p> <p><b></b></p> <h3><b>3. Use These Techniques to Relax</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>The more nervous you are, the faster you are going to speak. If you are naturally shy and have issues with public speaking, chances are you are going to speak even faster. Calm your nerves by following these relaxation tips before you go in for your interview:</p><p></p><ul><li>Practice deep breathing.</li><li>Prepare ahead of time for an interview by reading through common interview questions, which will help you feel more confident.</li><li>Visualize the interview beforehand.</li><li>Learn all you can about the company where you will be interviewing, the hiring manager and what their corporate culture is like so you can get an idea of what is expected of you.</li><li>Find out more about the job description and put together a list of questions you may have about the position. The more prepared you feel, the more likely you are to be relaxed.</li></ul><p></p> <p></p> <p>No one is perfect. Chances are you will be a little nervous during your job interview. However, you can surmount these nerves and come across as being cool and collected by taking the time to get prepared.</p> <p></p>"Career,How to Start a Career in Fashion,"<h1>Nine Ways to Start a Career in Fashion<br></h1> <p>You love fashion, and you think you possess the talent and commitment it takes to be a designer but how do you start a career in fashion? Here are nine tips.</p><h3>Scope Out the Competition</h3><p>You wont go far unless you do plenty of research on why certain designs make fashionistas tick. This means paying close attention to what sells as well as what doesnt. Analyze the components of leading fashion trends and check out the bestsellers of the worlds leading fashion houses. Incorporate what you learn. For example, if you discover that large handbags are a perennial favorite, then capitalize on this knowledge by creating a line of roomy, commodious totes, hobos and satchels.</p> <h3>Meet Everyone</h3><p>Networking will give you your most important entries into the fashion world, so its crucial to be seen. Show up at everything, and meet the movers and shakers in your industry. Let them know what youre doing, how your work is different and why youre passionate about it.</p> <h3>Pay Attention to Marketing Prospects</h3><p>Its a good idea to attend retail industry shows, especially ones that involve new product marketing. Go anywhere you can display models of your creations. Retail executives often send buyers to these types of shows, and if you can impress the right person, you might end up with a retail contract.</p> <h3>Consider the Importance of Design School</h3><p>Not every big-name fashion designer has a diploma from a fashion institute, but a reputable school can give you a solid background that will better prepare you for the demands of the industry and can give you a wealth of networking opportunities.</p> <h3>Consider Being an Apprentice</h3><p>If youve got the time and enough money in your savings account, consider getting in touch with one of the famous design houses in New York or Europe and apprenticing yourself there. You wont make much money, youll work long hours and you may have to put up with temper tantrums, but youll learn virtually everything you need to know about the fashion industry.<br></p> <h3>Break in Through Retail</h3><p>If youre an absolute beginner, consider working in an upscale boutique where you can learn about marketing and identifying your target audience. By checking job sites such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>, you can find retailers that could give you the experience you need to further your fashion career.</p> <h3>Dont be a Jack-of-All-Trades</h3><p>Find your niche and stick to it. If you have a talent or special interest in evening wear, for example, then concentrate on this genre. Likewise, if your great love is accessories, concentrate on these rather than trying to develop a full clothing line.<br></p> <h3>Get Organized</h3><p>Make a list of goals, such as retailers for which youd like to design or designers for whom youd like to work. Strategize so that you can reach these specific goals but dont try to rush things too much. A great fashion career doesnt happen overnight, and it takes years to develop your network, not to mention your skills.<br></p> <h3>Be Prepared for Success</h3><p>Dont set up meetings with influential designers or retailers without having a rock-solid fashion portfolio. If possible, try to arrange it so that youve had at least one small-scale fashion show or some impressive-looking fashion sales (of your own designs) under your belt before trying to hit the big time. If youve got a loaded resume, the giants in the industry will take you much more seriously.</p> <p>In the end, the most important thing you can do is keep your head on your shoulders and be realistic. Stay passionate, but dont romanticize about the so-called glamour aspects of a career in fashion. Its not only hard work; it also demands a certain amount of natural skill and ability. Its one of those super-difficult, yet ultra-rewarding jobs that many would do, if they could.</p> <p></p>"Interviews,How to Use Humor During a Job Interview,"<h1>5 Ways to Use Humor in a Job Interview</h1> <p>You got your foot in the door, and its time for your job interview. You shook hands, sat down, and youre smiling at the person across the desk. Suddenly, you find yourself saying, ""So, stop me if youve heard this one. A guy walks into a bar""</p><p>If youve ever started an interview this way, its a safe bet you didnt get the job. To say that jokes are considered time-wasters in a job interview is an understatement. However, there are ways you can use humor in a job interview to your advantage.Here are five ways you can use humor to lighten up the atmosphere without jeopardizing your prospects.</p> <p></p><h3><b>Scope out your interviewer</b></h3>If you see the barest hint of an obligatory job interview smile, use humor sparingly. For example, you can have a chuckle, ever so slightly, about the easier commute to this new location. If, on the other hand, youre lucky enough to get a genial, smiling interviewer, you can relax a bit<b></b>just not too much.<p></p> <h3><b>Use humor as an inflection, not as a key to your personality</b></h3><p>You dont want to come across as a laugh-a-minute type of person; it's obnoxious in a work setting. Just as some people talk too much when theyre nervous, some people try to be funny in order to mask their nerves. If youve noticed that the jokes are starting to fly, take it down several notches.</p> <h3><b>Keep it general</b></h3><p>Everyone has a different sense of humor, and people react to funny comments in different ways. For these reasons, its best to keep your observations as general as possible, talking about things that we can all relate to, such as the weather or the traffic. They might not seem like prime laugh material, but unless youre auditioning for a position as a piano bar entertainer, they're a lot safer.</p> <h3><b>Aim for being pleasant rather than funny</b></h3><p>Youre not selling yourself as a comedian. Youre selling yourself as an engaged, easy-to-work-with co-worker. Youll want your interviewers notes to read, ""ready with a smile"" rather than ""cracks jokes all the time."" </p> <h3><b>Instead of jokes, use little asides</b></h3><p>Chances are theres not going to be time for a joke-telling session during your interview, so instead, focus on interjecting a few humorous remarks at the right time. These can be self-deprecating. For example, if you have several glowing newspaper write-ups in your portfolio, you can say, ""Oh, well, it was a slow news week."" If youve won Employee of the Month a number of times, you can say, ""Stuffing the ballot box works every time."" But before you indulge in self-deprecating humor, check to see it your interviewer has a sense of humor to begin with, and dont say anything that he or she might take seriously.</p> <p>If you decide to use humor in a job interview, you will be walking a tightrope. However, if you can pull it off, the effort is worth it. After all, job sites like <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> are full of job postings that mention ""A sense of humor is a must in this job."" As long as you keep it clean, keep it appropriate and dont bring out your killer Beavis and Butthead imitations, a touch of humor can distance you from the rest of the pack.<br><br></p> <p><b>For More Info:</b></p> <p><a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-57391371/no-joke-how-to-use-humor-in-a-job-interview/"">No Joke: How to Use Humor in a Job Interview</a> (CBS News)</p><p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nancy-berk/humor-on-the-job-intervie_b_3837214.html"">Humor in the Job Interview is No Laughing Matter</a> (Huffington Post)</p>"Resumes,Is it Necessary to Include Every Job You've Had on a Resume?,"<h1>Is it Necessary to Include Every Job You've Had on a Resume?</h1><p>You've graduated into a weak economy, and you don't have a lot of job experience. Or maybe you're just starting your career. You want to make the most of what you have done to catch the eyes of hiring managers. You put hours of time into your resume, making a list of every job you've held since you could work. Food service, lawn care, babysittingif you remember it, you put it on the resume.</p><p>You are quite proud of your five-page resume, but for some reason you don't get nearly the response you expected. Why? Because you're including too much information.</p><p>You don't need to include every job you've ever had on your resume.</p><div><h3>Picking and Choosing</h3></div><p>The first thing to ask yourself: Is this job relevant to the job I am seeking? Instead of including many unrelated jobs on your resume, choose the positions that required skills and expertise desirable to your future employer. When you limit the number of jobs listed on your resume, you might wonder if your resume is too short. But the hiring manager will be pleased that you spent time tailoring your resume to the position. He doesn't have to wonder why you included the job you held at age 16 because you only revealed relevant experience.</p><p>You might worry that you've recently graduated and you've never worked in your chosen field. The best option for overcoming this resume shortcoming is an internship.</p><p>Internships are not always an option, however, so comb over your previous positions. You probably have some applicable skills that match up with the position you're seeking. List those jobs if they exemplify the skills necessary for the job you seek.</p><p>Think of your resume as a marketing tool. You want to convince your employer to pick you, and that's not going to happen if the signal-to-noise ratio in your resume is skewed.</p><p>Once you get a good template set, you can use it to alter your resume to include different job types and industries so each resume you send is unique. While human resources workers can't tell you specifically how they rate prospective employees, they will tell you that putting every job you have ever had on your resume is not the way to go.</p><div><h3><b>What about Contract and Other Short-Term Positions?</b></h3></div><p>If you had a job that lasted a few months, and it was not a short-term contract position, consider not including it on your resume. Why? You don't want your job history showing that you frequently moved from job to job. It's expensive to train an employee. Each employee is an investment, and no one wants to invest in an individual who is going to jump ship as soon as he gets the chance.</p><p>Contract positions are a entirely different subject, as they're intended to be short-term projects. As with your job history, keep only the relevant contract positions on your resume. If you have related skills for the contract gigs, include these as well. Some contract work is tricky to list, especially if you signed a non-disclosure agreement with your client. If this is the case, don't mention the position or the clients protected under the agreement. Otherwise, relevant contracts are great to list on your resume, as they show that you're flexible with your work.</p>"Job Search Tips,Is it OK to Contact a Company After Applying for a Job?,"<h1>Is it OK to Contact a Company After Applying for a Job?</h1><p>After applying for a job you really want, you might wonder what you can do to increase your chances of being noticed by the hiring manager. The good news is you can do more than just wait around and hope after sending your resume. In many cases, contacting the company is considered a good move, as long as you follow a few basic rules and don't show you're overeager. <br></p> <h3>Be Patient <br></h3> <p>It is not unusual for companies to attract thousands of applicants for a single position. It will take more than a day or two for the HR team or its software to sort through the applications, so resist the urge to call the same day you submit your resume. <a href=""http://work.chron.com/call-inquire-job-after-submitting-resume-8225.html"">The Houston Chronicle</a> advises that you wait about one week before you contact anyone at the company. <br></p> <h3>Read the Fine Print Before Reaching Out <br></h3> <p>Some employers have preferences when it comes to contact with applicants. Be sure to read any information you have about the application process to see if there are instructions for job candidates. For example, some companies request that you not call them, and nearly all of them advise against applicants showing up at their office out of the blue. To be on the safe side, <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/01/23/how-to-follow-up-on-your-job-application"">U.S. News & World Report</a> suggests sending an email, since this method of contact is not obtrusive and does not require an immediate response. This way, even if you don't get a response back regarding your application, you have done your part to show you are interested in the company. <br></p> <h3>Find the Right Contact Information <br></h3> <p>When it comes to contacting an employer, the more specific you are, the better. Ideally, you should be able to address the person in charge of making hiring decisions. If you do not know the name of this person, you might have to do some research online to find it. According to the Houston Chronicle, you can also call the company and ask for the name of the person in charge of hiring for the position in which you are interested. Then you can include the name and title in the email or at least address the right person over the phone if you prefer to call to check on your application. <br></p> <h3>Be Polite <br></h3> <p>If you have been waiting for weeks with no reply, you might be feeling anxious and impatient, but don't let the employer know that. Make sure you are calm and collected when you call or email about the job. You may contact the company a few different times to get answers after applying for a job, but avoid calling every day. Your goal is to show you are interested in the position, not obsessive about it. <br></p><p></p><p> </p><h3>What to Include in Your Follow-Up Email <br></h3> <p>If you decide to send an email about the job, focus on being both succinct and professional. Leave out any emoticons or slang, and keep it just a few sentences long. According to <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2010/12/27/how-to-follow-up-after-applying-for-a-job"">U.S. News & World Report</a>, mention that you submitted an application for a job ad and would like to make sure it was received. Be sure to state which position you're contacting the company about and the date you sent the application, and then wrap up the email by reiterating your interest and suitability for the job. You can save the longer follow-up email for after you get an interview!</p>"Interviews,Job Interview Body Language Tips,"<h1>Job Interview Body Language Tips</h1><p>When interviewing for a job, everything you say or do is on full display for the interviewer, including your body language. Your body language is under observation before the first question is asked, and maybe even before you and your interviewer are introduced to one another. How you present yourself, the way you walk and even the way you talk will all factor into the interviewer's opinion of how you would fit in with the company. Here are five body language tips to keep in mind for your next job interview.<br></p><h3><b>1. Posture</b></h3><p>Good posture makes you look confident. Use good posture at all times when you arrive at your job interview. This goes for walking in, sitting in the waiting room, walking to your interview and sitting down during your interview. You never know who is watching you. Walk upright and not hunched over, with your chin up and arms at your side<b>. </b>Sit upright with your chin up and keep both feet on the floor. Your hands should be either resting on your knees or clasped in front of you; crossing your legs is frowned upon because some feel it makes you look too relaxed. For women, crossing your legs at the ankles is a good compromise. </p><h3><b>2. Smile</b></h3><p>This should be something that you plan to do first and foremost when you enter a room, both at the front desk as you check in and with the interviewer. This will let an employer know you are happy to be there and display that you have a positive attitude as well. The bigger the smile, the better, as long as it doesn't come off as forced or fake. A bright smile will reflect your enthusiasm, so use it to your advantage.</p><h3><b>3. Handshake</b></h3><p>Use a good, firm handshake when you are interviewing. A firm handshake is a business prerequisite that reflects enthusiasm and professionalism; do not underestimate its importance. A limp or weak handshake displays a lack of energy, confidence and enthusiasm and gives the idea that you may approach your work in the same fashion. You should also check to be sure your hands aren't damp. If you sometimes have this problem, give your hands a quick check before entering the interview room. </p><h3><b>4. Eye Contact</b></h3><p>Eye contact is a vital sign of body language that interviewers will watch closely. Making eye contact with your interviewer shows that you are listening and interested in what is being said. You should also nod every now and then to let the interviewer know that you understand the conversation and agree. Breaking eye contact briefly every so often is wise as well, because prolonged eye contact can be awkward. By maintaining proper eye contact you also show the interviewer that you aren't intimidated by the interview process.</p><h3><b>5. Hand Gestures</b></h3>Some people say not to talk with your hands at a job interview, but actually you should use hand gestures when it makes sense. However, keep hand gestures to a minimum. While small gestures look genuine, large and sweeping motions can make you appear to be a loose cannon. Not using gestures at all can make you come across as stiff or fake. Natural hand gestures are good; just don't overdo it!<p></p><p></p><p>Relax, but remain aware of your body language. Be polite, professional and friendly<b></b>and sit up straight! You will make a better impression on your interviewer.</p><p></p><p></p>"Job Search Tips,Job Websites for Teachers,"<p></p><h1>Job Websites for Teachers</h1><p>Browsing job websites for teachers can help you find the right teaching position.

They need an outstanding resume as well. When creating your first resume as an undergrad, including the right information is important. One question that seems to be on every college grad's mind is whether or not grade point average (GPA) has a place on a resume. The short answer: it depends.</p><p></p><h3><b>Whats your GPA?</b></h3>Know where you stand. Is your GPA high, low or average? The <a href=""http://smg.bu.edu/upo/docs/Guidelines-IncludingGPAonResumes.pdf"">Feld Career Center at Boston University </a>suggests including your cumulative GPA only if it is above 3.0. It recommends that you carry it two places past the decimal (i.e. 3.77, not 3.8) to ensure that you are representing yourself truthfully. If your cumulative grade-point average is lower than youd like, you could opt for using your major's GPA or concentration's GPA instead, as long as you indicate clearly which one it is.<p></p><p></p><h3><b>What are your strengths?</b></h3>Remember, the purpose of your resume is to showcase your strengths, not to point out your shortcomings. If you were far from the head of the class, consider omitting your GPA altogether. Do make sure you emphasize strong areas, though. Maybe youre an excellent team player, an excellent leader or an award-winning orator. Be sure to let prospective employers know how much you have to offer beyond your test scores, and be prepared to back up any claims you make once you land an interview.<p></p><p></p><h3><b>Whats your industry?</b></h3>Different fields have different attitudes toward grade point averages. Technical fields, such as engineering and computer science, expect to see GPA in candidate's resumes, while liberal arts and graphic design employers are not as likely to expect to see them. One major at <a href=""http://www.career.vt.edu/resumeguide/FAQs.html"">Virginia Tech</a> actually considers 3.4 to be the minimum grade point average for students. If you know the interviewer is absolutely going to be looking for a GPA on your resume because it is standard in your field, but youre not very proud of your 2.91, its better to include it than to let the interviewer guess. Would you rather him see your 2.91 or assume you had a 2.75?<p></p><p></p><h3><b>How much experience do you have?</b></h3>When you have several years of relevant experience, your GPA becomes unimportant. By being able to prove that you have strong, well-developed skills and an established track record, employers find it less important for you to show your collegiate grades. Employers will be much more satisfied to see what you have done with your education, rather than how well you did on your tests.<p></p><p></p><h3><b>The bottom line</b></h3>When you are completing your resume, its important to make yourself look great. In a sea of competition, you need to be able to prove youre the best catch. When it comes to your GPA, you should absolutely include yours if its high for your industry or if you believe it is a good representation of your abilities. Dont feel obligated to include your GPA if its not very high. Just be willing to go the extra mile to prove your worthiness to potential employers. At the end of the day, if an interviewer wants to know, they will ask."Resumes,"Oh, No! My Resume Has a Typo! What Should I Do?","<h1>Oh, No! My Resume Has a Typo! What Should I Do?</h1><div><p>So you've found the perfect job opportunity, and you can't wait to attach your resume and cover letter and click send. However, there's one problem: You became so excited that you had attached your resume and submitted it before double-checking the spelling, and you realize you overlooked a typo.</p><p>At this point, you're probably thinking, ""Oh, no. Now I'll never get the job."" Or: ""They'll probably think I don't have a good eye for detail."" Whatever you do, don't send that apology email just yet. There's no need to panic. You can fix this error. If you submitted your resume and realized that there's a glaring typo on it, there are a few things you can do about it.</p><h3>Leave It Be:Don't Fret Over Punctuation Errors</h3></div><div>If your resume contained a punctuation error, such as a missing period or a misplaced comma, chances are the person reading your resume won't even notice. According to advice from<a href=""http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/you-found-errors-in-your-resume-after-sending-it-to-an-employer-now-what-HA010167314.aspx"">Microsoft,</a>which creates popular resume templates,minor errors such as these are not worth worrying over, but you should update and edit your resume and save the new version.</div><h3>Resend It if There Are Large Errors</h3><div>If you have many errors on your resume, or if you have one egregious typo such as the company's name, it's best to resend the resume. Hoping the recruiter won't see a glaring typo is like wishing that your resume was eaten by email goblins. (It's highly unlikely). The right thing you can do in this situation is to simply resend your resume, along with a cover letter, explaining that you have attached an updated version. You can write something along the lines of:</div><div><br></div><div>""I am very interested in working for your company, and therefore, I want to make sure that you have the most current version of my resume.""</div><div><br></div><div>Whatever you do, don't admit that your typo was an oversight. Some companies use software to sort and store resumes. This software updates when it receives a new version automatically, so chances are the company might never see the old one if you send the new version quickly enough.</div><h3>Resend It andApologize if You're Contacted</h3><div>Every so often a company will be nice enough to call you and point out a typo on your resume. If this happens, they'll usually ask for an updated one. This shows a clear interest in you as a candidate for the job, so apologize and resend the resume. Do not over-apologize, though. Just resend the resume, and write in the subject line, ""Updated Resume.""<a href=""http://www.payscale.com/career-news/2013/04/so-you-made-a-typo-on-your-resume.-now-what-"">Pay Scale</a> advises re-sending the resume without adding any information in the email admitting the typo or says not to use the word ""fixed.""</div><div><br></div><div>As you can see, sending a resume with a typo isn't the end of the world. Decide whether the error is significant enough to warrant a new email or minor enough to ignore. Whatever the case may be, fix the error right away and make sure the new version is the only one remaining. If the error isn't discovered online but in your interview instead, be prepared with an updated copy of your edited resume. If the interviewing manager points out the error in the interview, politely apologize and hand over the updated version. Politeness trumps mistakes at the end, and they're likely to overlook the typo if they're interest.</div>"Resumes,Pepper Your Resume with the Right Keywords,"<h2>Pepper Your Resume with the Right Keywords</h2><p>Your resume is a powerful marketing tool that can land you the interview you need to get the job you want.

Many companies use software to eliminate resumes before anyone ever sees them. A perfectly qualified candidate might be eliminated because of a lack of keywords.</p><p>This makes the inclusion of keywords an essential component of your resume-writing process. Thats why the <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323949404578314220242353956.html""><i>Wall Street Journal</i>s</a> Dennis Nishi wrote, ""On top of genuinely qualifying for the job, you have to be able to back the right keywords with substance while also providing a resume thats readable to humans.""</p><h3>Where Do You Find the Keywords You Need?</h3><p>Some keywords are specific to an industry. Others are applicable only to a certain line of work. So how do you ensure your resume has the right keywords? Each position you apply for is unique. If you customize your resume to the specific position, using the keywords the recruiter uses in the job advertisement, you can target your resume to the employer.</p><p>Nishi also <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323949404578314220242353956.html"">wrote</a>, ""The job posting will provide many verbs, nouns and job-specific terms that youll need to echolike Adobe CS fluency and Cisco certification or actionable phrases that you can key off of like conceive and execute, results driven, visual thinker and punctual and prompt.""</p><p>By pulling your keywords straight from the job advertisement, youll highlight the qualities that companies are looking for. To target a specific employer, however, you should take it one step further and surf the companys website. There you can find additional keywords your prospective employers use to describe their organizations, the work they do and the culture they have created. While the computer program may or may not care about those keywords, the manager looking to hire a new employee will.</p><h3>How Do You Use Keywords in Your Resume?</h3><p>Moore <a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9228162/Your_resume_Getting_past_the_machines"">says</a>, ""Automated tracking systems are pretty smart. You must use keywords in the proper context, or the ATS might ignore your resume."" You should also use keywords throughout your resume to show that they werent simply an afterthought. Using keywords isnt enough; you have to use them well.</p><p>Have you ever heard the phrase ""keyword stuffing?"" Its used to describe online content that is created for search engines without consideration of whether the copy is readable. The same mistake can be made in creating a resume.</p><p><a></a>The ATS is only a first line of defense. Once you get past the computers, you still have to win the interest of the hiring manager.

This might be true, as both inferior and superior job candidates dont stay up-to-date on resume-writing strategies the way professional resume writers do.</p><p>The primary advantage of hiring a resume writer is that youre hiring someone who is more knowledgeable about self-marketing than you are. Contrary to what Nemko claims, a resume is not comparable to a college application; it's comparable to an advertisement. Its perfectly ethical to hire someone to create an advertisement for you. Its the employers responsibility to properly vet candidates, and many of them do, which is why many resume writers are committed to presenting an honest but appealing story of their client to potential employers.</p><h3>The Professional Resume</h3><p>A resume is a marketing document. You are marketing your ability to do a job whenever you submit a resume to a potential employer. The job of the resume is to communicate your abilities, experiences and training in such a way that you interest the potential employer enough to contact you for an interview. A well-written resume cant do anything more than that. A well-written resume wont get you a job. It will simply help you present yourself as a viable candidate.<br></p><p>Like advertisements, resume styles and requirements are subject to change. For example, objectives are considered outdated by some. Contemporary resumes often begin with something thats more like a sales pitch than a classic objective. In the past, resumes focused on past job duties; now they focus on former job accomplishments. Contemporary resumes have to make it through a gauntlet of computer programs, recruiters and HR professionals before they ever reach the manager who needs your services.</p><p>The professional resume writers job is to keep up with all these changes and to produce a current resume that gets results. A resume writer will also pull relevant information from you in order to communicate your story effectively. A professionally written resume will communicate your experience, accomplishments, training and abilities. Its your responsibility to submit your resume for jobs that youre actually qualified to do. </p><h3>Getting the Services You Need</h3><p>Unfortunately, there are some resume-writing services that just arent up to snuff. <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2010/12/07/tips-for-hiring-a-professional-resume-writer"">Andrew Rosen</a> of U.S. News providedthese tips for hiring the right professional resume writer to help in your job search:</p><ul><li>Think about what you want from your resume before you speak with a resume writer.

You might be surprised, and even amused, to learn where they got their start. The next time you are wondering how your current career could possibly carry you to your dream job, take some inspiration from the people on this list. <br></p> <h3>Ralph Lauren: From Sales Assistant to Fashion Designer </h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/what-successful-people-did-in-their-20s-2013-3#ralph-lauren-was-a-sales-assistant-at-brooks-brothers-5"">Business Insider</a>, Ralph Lauren got his start in fashion as a sales assistant for Brooks Brothers on Madison Avenue. But he had plans. At night, he took business classes at a local college. After a couple of years as a sales assistant, he tried his hand at clothing design, eventually creating a necktie that would catch the eye of famous designers. Soon after, he quit his job to create his own company. Neiman Marcus gave him his first big break by buying dozens of the ties he designed. His commitment to learning the business side of fashion on his own time allowed him to branch out from his job at a major clothing store and become a success in the fashion industry. <br></p> <h3>Roman Abramovich: From Toy Sales to Business Buyouts </h3> <p>Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich now owns Britain's Chelsea Football Club and is among the richest people in the world, according to <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-299664/Britains-new-richest-man.html"">The Daily Mail</a>. But his beginnings were rather humble. He was an orphan at the age of 3. As a teenager, he sold plastic toys, including rubber ducks, at a local market. He went to school and made dolls, gradually investing in other businesses along the way. As he accumulated wealth, he continued to buy up businesses in various industries, leading him to become a self-made billionaire. </p> <h3>Howard Schultz: From Xerox Copies to Starbucks Coffee </h3> <p>Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, got his start in a career that had nothing to do with coffee. He was originally a salesman for Xerox, according to <a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/197692"">Entrepreneur</a>. Hammerplast, which made coffeemakers, noticed his skills and recruited him to become the general manager and vice president of the business. While in that job, he noticed that Starbucks, which was a small company at the time, was continually buying espresso machines made by Hammerplast. He decided to visit Starbucks in Seattle and was invited to become the head of marketing and retail operations. Seeing potential in the small company, he eventually bought the chain and made several improvements, helping Starbucks expand greatly during the 1990s. It's entirely possible you're reading this inside a Starbucks right now.<br></p> <h3>Michael Dell: From Dishwasher to Dell CEO </h3> <p>Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Computers, didn't start out looking for a career in the technology industry, according to the<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/13/first-jobs-super-rich_n_1765391.html#slide=1363121"">Huffington Post</a>. He worked a variety of jobs as a teenager in order to pay for his stamp collection. His first job was as a dishwasher at a Chinese restaurant, but he quickly moved up to become the assistant matre d. Soon after that, he moved onto another job as a newspaper vendor, where he learned to look closely at the needs of customers before trying to sell them a product. According to an interview with the <a href=""http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/del0int-5"">American Academy of Achievement</a>, he brought this high level of customer service to Dell, where he makes it a point to stay in touch with customers to ensure the company is offering what they need. Combining this attention to customer service with his passion for technology has helped him become successful as the CEO of Dell. <br></p><h3>J.K.

Rowling was in her 20s, she was a secretary at Amnesty International in London. But her passion for writing did not allow her to fully focus on her job. Because she often daydreamed about her characters, such as Harry Potter, she was let go from her job as secretary. Her severance was enough to ensure she could fully focus on writing her famous series. Her fans should be thankful for her inability to focus on her job as a secretary.</p><p>The people highlighted above all ended up with successful careers by working hard and having drive.

This is especially true for positions that require time and money for specific training, only for the ranks of employment within that field to be reduced soon after. Below are five of the fastest-shrinking jobs in America. It's possible to get work in these fields, but you'll find that other careers are far more promising.<br></p> <h3>Postal Workers </h3> <p>Youve probably noticed the increased dependency on technology when it comes to staying in contact with loved ones, paying bills and shopping from catalogs. If you tend to use a computer for these tasks, you can see why postal workers are not nearly as necessary as they once were. Not surprisingly, the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_105.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> claims that postal jobs are on the decline. More specifically, postal service worker positions will be cut by about 48 percent by the year 2020 while postmaster jobs will decline by nearly 28 percent. <br></p> <h3>Farmers and Ranchers <br></h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.boston.com/bostonworks/galleries/30fast_declining_occupations?pg=25"">The Boston Globe</a>, agricultural jobs will be cut by about 8 percent by 2020. The reason for this is that farms have been consolidating while at the same time, the productivity of farming operations has been increasing. That means fewer farmers and ranchers are needed. But the good news is there will still be some need for a new generation of farmers as the current ones retire. If you're passionate about agriculture, you might have a better chance in this industry if you are willing to keep up with the latest farming technologies and get a 2- or 4-year degree in this field. <br></p> <h3>Desktop Publishers </h3> <p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/02/jobs-disappearing-dying-declining-layoffs_n_1847119.html#slide=1459767"">The Huffington Post</a> reports a decline in the desktop publishing industry, which involves formatting and then printing books, brochures, newsletters, calendars and other materials that are now increasingly digital. More specifically, this field is set to decline by nearly 15 percent in the coming years. Some materials are no longer printed these days, but digital publications still need to be formatted. This means you can survive in this field if you can embrace the technology used today in desktop publishing. If you are familiar with the latest desktop publishing software, HTML, and web developing basics, you can still work on formatting websites, e-books, online magazines, email newsletters, and other digital publications. For the best chance at this type of job, make sure you have an associate's degree. <br></p> <h3>Data Entry Workers </h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.boston.com/bostonworks/galleries/30fast_declining_occupations?pg=30"">The Boston Globe</a>, data entry positions will decline by about 7 percent by 2020. This is another casualty of the growing technology industry because software programs can now do the job of the typical data entry worker. Similarly, typists are not relied on as much because most people have their own computers. If you want to work in these types of positions, you are advised to have a few different skills that make you more valuable to employers. This means you should combine data entry, proofreading and telephone skills so you can apply for positions that include secretary or personal assistant. <br></p> <h3>Textile Machine Setters </h3> <p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/the-30-jobs-that-are-disappearing-fastest-in-america-2012-2?op=1"">Business Insider</a> reports that several jobs related to textiles will be on the decline. More specifically, shrinking jobs include textile machine setters, tenders and operators, all of which are expected to decline by about 18 percent by 2020. The reason is that companies in the U.S. can do these jobs less expensively overseas. This means many companies will increasingly choose to import textiles from other countries.</p><p>Avoiding the fastest shrinking jobs may help you enjoy a more secure financial future.

Try to make your exit without burning any bridges. Oh, sure, you might dream of sending a scathing email to your boss or simply walking out of the building with all of the break room granola bars, but these actions are much less satisfying than you imagine. In fact, they can have long-term consequences. If you want to avoid damaging your reputation, and you want to set yourself up for a better job down the road, always leave your job with class. <br></p> <h3><b>Avoid spreading the news too early </b></h3> <p>If your choice to leave your job is a planned move rather than a spur-of-the-moment decision, you will probably spend some time looking for a new job first. If you have become friendly with your coworkers, it is tempting to tell them about your job search, especially once you have found a promising lead. But this type of information has a tendency to spread around the office, in which case your boss could find out about your departure before you have a chance to tell him or her yourself. This is why <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/1824779/how-quit-your-job-gracefully-if-youre-not-greg-smith"">Fast Company</a> advises you to stay quiet until you tell your boss the official news. <br></p> <h3><b>Preserve relationships </b></h3> <p>You never know when a job contact can be useful in the future, so make an effort to stay in touch with managers, coworkers, clients and vendors. Whether you are choosing to leave or are being laid off or fired, thanking the people who helped you during your time at your current job is a good idea. You can send an email or simply shake hands and thank them in person on your way out. <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/06/04/10-tips-for-leaving-your-job-gracefully-"">U.S. News & World Report</a> even suggests that you get some references in writing, either before you leave or shortly afterward. You can also ask to use a manager or a coworker as a reference for your next job. <br></p> <h3><b>Collect helpful information </b></h3> <p>Before you leave, you should get the contact information of colleagues so you can easily stay in touch. Also, keep samples of your work so you can show future employers any writing, designs or other work you have done. Just be sure to check with HR or your boss to make sure this is not against the rules.</p><p>Before you leave, take a tip from <a href=""http://blogs.hbr.org/2010/11/leave-your-job-the-classy-way/"">Harvard Business Review</a> and create a Smile File. This should consist of thank-you notes from your boss, emails complimenting your work, great reviews and any awards you won at that job. Not only will this collection of positive things boost your morale, but it could even help you land your next position.<br></p> <h3><b>Help your employer find a replacement </b></h3> <p>It is still customary to give notice two weeks before you leave a job, though you might want to give more notice if you think it will take longer than two weeks to find your replacement. In fact, some particularly helpful employees go out of their way to ensure a smooth transition for their replacement, boss and the company as a whole. If you still respect your employer and really want to help, this article in<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jaleh-bisharat/how-to-quit-a-job_b_3877020.html"">The Huffington Post</a> advises you to make a cheat sheet for your replacement.</p><p>Make note of everything the new hire needs to know to thrive in the position, and include log-in information, file locations and helpful tips you have learned over the years. You can even volunteer to help advertise the job opening and interview applicants, which should help you get a positive reference from your boss. </p>"Career,The Mid-Career Internship,"<h1><b>The Mid-Career Internship</b></h1> <p>Whether you have been out of the workforce for a while or in the same line of work for years, you might feel like it is time to start something new. Mid-career internships are becoming a more common way for established professionals to take their careers in a new direction. In fact, <a href=""http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?id=pr582&sd=8%2F11%2F2010&ed=12%2F31%2F2010"">a Career Builder survey</a>found that 23 percent of employers have seen an increase in experienced and mature workers apply for internships. Should you consider a mid-career internship? Here's some info to help you make the decision.</p> <h3><b>Taking the Leap</b></h3> <p>Making the decision to start over can be overwhelming. Leaving your career to begin an internship in a different field means taking a significant pay cut. Even leaving your job temporarily might signal to your current employer that you're no longer enthusiastic about your job. Theres also the fear of the unknown, of starting from scratch and of taking orders from someone younger. Prepare yourself.</p> <h3><b>The Transition</b></h3> <p>Returning to work after a long period of unemployment can pose challenges. If you are coming back to the workplace, an internship might then be a good option. Youll be able to establish or re-establish yourself in your industry and apply for full-time jobs with a fresh new outlook and the added value of recent experience. <br></p><p>If you already have a full-time job then you have several options. You can work part-time temporarily and make time for the internship on top of your job. You can use vacation time, if you have enough time saved. Or you can take a leave of absence or quit your job and focus completely on your new career.</p> <h3><b>Getting In</b></h3> <p>While you have many options for finding an internship, one tried and true method is to go through a formal internship program while talking classes at a local college. Colleges are able to help students with internships, and most offer job placement services. Because you're attending school, you will bring with you the credibility of the institution. It looks good. You have educated yourself and learned a new skill.</p><p>If going to school is not an option, you can find internships through job search engines such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/a/jobs/list/q-internships"">Simply Hired.</a></p><p></p> <h3><b>Adaptation</b></h3> <p>The conventional wisdom is that middle-aged people arent as flexible at changing jobs as younger people. Youre going to have to dispel that notion. Be flexible and engaged. Ask questions. Make the most out of every moment as an intern so you are able to secure the best possible job after your term is over.</p> <h3><b>Regarding Pay</b></h3> <p>You might not be paid, but it still might be worth it. Unpaid internships are legal as long as they are with a non-profit organization, or if they're acquired through school-sponsored programs (as mentioned above). Private sector companies are only allowed to offer unpaid internships <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/whd/"">if they meet six criteria</a>:</p> <p></p><ul><li>Training must be comparable to an educational environment<br></li><li>Experience benefits the intern<br></li><li>Intern does not replace a regular employee<br></li><li>Employer does not immediately benefit from interns role<br></li><li>No guarantee of employment after internship<br></li><li>Mutual understanding that the intern will not be paid</li></ul> <h3><b>Ready to Find an Internship?</b></h3> <p>Taking on a mid-career internship is an opportunity to test drive a new path or expand your current skill set. It will give you the chance to branch out and meet new people, and it can win you valuable experience. When youre ready to get more out of your work, weigh your options. An internship might be just what you need to start transforming your career.</p> <p><br></p>"Job Search Tips,Use Loose Connections to Get Your Next Job,"<h2><b>Use Loose Connection to Get Your Next Job</b></h2> <p></p> <p>The conventional way to get a job is to scour job ads, send your resum to employers and wait for a response. But this is not always the most effective way to get a job. Many positions are not advertised or are promised to someone who knows someone. Another way to get a job that requires a little more work but often nets big results is to network with ""loose connections,"" those acquaintances who work in your industry but who are not necessarily close friends. Indeed, <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2011/06/07/networking-is-still-the-best-way-to-find-a-job-survey-says/"">Forbes</a> reports that in 2011 some 41 percent of individuals found their jobs through such networking. </p> <h3><b>Practice Your Small Talk Skills</b></h3> <p>You never know who may be connected to the industry in which you want to work, so its important to be open to meeting people wherever you go. Practice making small talk with people in stores, at parties and on the street. Find out what they do. Tell them what you do and what you are trying to do with your career.</p> <h3><b>Be Specific About What You Want</b></h3> <p>Your loose connections may want to help, but if you aren't specific enough they won't be able to assist you. Be clear about the kind of job you want. In addition to knowing the industry, you should understand:</p> <p></p><ul><li>The position you're seeking<br></li><li>The types of skills you want to use<br></li><li>The salary range you want<br></li></ul><p></p> <p>Once you figure it out, synthesize it into a statement you can make when telling your connections about your job hunt.</p> <h3><b>Mention Your Job Search Naturally</b></h3> <p>When talking to your acquaintances, don't just blurt out that you are looking for work. Let it come up naturally in conversation. For example, mention that you're looking for a job only when your acquaintances ask what you have been up to or when they talk about their jobs. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Meet People Who are Tangentially Related</b></h3> <p>Don't limit your networking efforts to people who are directly connected to the industry you want to work for. You never know who may have the connections you need to get where you want to go. Be open to meeting all sorts of people. The more people you get to know, the more likely you are to meet someone who can let you in on job opportunities or put in a good word for you at a particular company. </p> <h3><b>Ask For References</b></h3> <p>One of the best ways to find a job is to directly contact people who you would like to use as references. Tell these individuals about the kind of job you are looking for and ask them if they would be willing to serve as references. They may have ideas for where to look. Even if they don't, they will be aware you are job hunting, which may start them thinking. It also ensuresthat you will have references when you do apply for jobs.</p><p></p> <p></p> <p>It can be unnerving to talk to connections about jobs, especially if you don't know them that well. Just remember that most people are happy to help. Be confident and kind when talking to loose connections and you will get job leads you otherwise wouldn't know existed.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"Career,What 'Average is Over' Means for You,"<h2>What Does 'Average Is Over' Mean for You?</h2><p>According to American economist Dr. Tyler Cowen, <a href=""http://stream.wsj.com/story/latest-headlines/SS-2-63399/SS-2-343190/"">""Average Is Over""</a> means that the American economy will not return to the good old, days, change is coming for American workers, machines will play a more important role in our lives and were going to see an increase in income inequality. Now, dont panic. According to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Average-Is-Over-Powering-Stagnation/dp/0525953736"">Cowen's new book of the same name</a>, all is not as dire as it seems.</p><h3>Understanding Cowens claims</h3><p>Cowen's assertions in ""Average is Over"" are:<br></p><ul><li>We are seeing the erosion of the old American economy and the start of something new.</li><li>The rich are going to get richer, and we wont have much of a middle class buffer.</li><li>Workers need to become better complements to machines in order to remain economically valuable.</li><li>Education for the elite will stay on its current track, while education for others who are self-motivated will follow a new, less expensive model.</li><li>Meritocracy will emerge over old networks.</li></ul><h3>Disputing Cowens conclusions</h3><p>Somebody was bound to say the economy is changing. Of all the people who could have, Dr. Cowen has the credibility to make the case for what our futures look like. However, its important to realize that the economy is full of unforeseen trends. While the trends Cowen examines are possible, there is no guarantee they will come to pass.</p><p><a href=""http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/09/tyler_cowen_on.html"">Russ Roberts of EconTalk</a>, for example, is skeptical of Cowens conclusions. Roberts thinks Cowens claims are based on projecting distorted data into the future, which results in distorted conclusions.</p><p>Furthermore, there are other trends that run counter to the ones Cowen discusses in his book. Corporate social responsibility and increasing entrepreneurship among recent college graduates are just two primary examples. Cowen doesnt seem to account for these economic forces in projecting the future.</p><h3>Preparing for Cowens economy</h3><p>Lets say that Cowen is right and the trends he cites become dominant in our economy. Does this mean that the future he predicts is inevitable?</p><p>You, like so many other empowered American workers, can still take hold of your own destiny. The key to your economic viability is not to settle for being average. Whether that means you make it to the top 15 percent of all earners or not, striving will give you a competitive edge when shaping your economic future.</p><p>Heres what you can do to prepare for the future envisioned in ""Average is Over"":</p><ul><li>Become self-motivated.<br></li><li>Become a master of the technology you use.<br></li><li>Seek out opportunities to work cooperatively with technology.<br></li><li>Become an effective interpreter of human behavior.<br></li><li>Become your own tech support by keeping up with current technologies.<br></li><li>Seek out educational opportunities that are encouraging and effective.<br></li></ul><p>Embracing the entrepreneurial spirit of trial and discovery no matter where you work will help you combine these elements and use them to propel your own economic future.</p><p><a></a>Cowens claims in ""Average Is Over"" are dire--for the unmotivated. The future he envisions is not inevitable for all. You dont have to be the victim of economic trends. You can become the power that drives your own economic future, whether Cowen is right or wrong.</p><p></p>"Career,What a Career Coach Does,"<h1>Is a Career Coach Right for You?<br></h1> <p>If you spend time on the Internet searching for jobs, chances are youve seen advertisements for career coaches. Perhaps youve even wondered if a professional career coach can help you find a better job. Let's explore.</p> <h3>What does a career coach do? </h3> <p>A career coach will work with you to help you identify your professional strengths and weaknesses. This may involve assessing your talents at negotiating, communicating and presenting your work, as well as your skills at applying yourself. A coach will also help you examine where you are in your career, why youre there and whether or not its where you truly want to be.In addition, if youre between jobs, a coach can help you utilize your skills and tools to their fullest potential when it comes to marketing, networking and maneuvering yourself into that ideal job.</p> <p>As for pros and cons, a career coach will:</p> <p></p><ul><li>Help you prioritize your professional needs<br></li><li>Help you identify and market your skills<br></li><li>Help you pinpoint what youre doing right and what youre doing wrong in your career<br></li></ul><p></p> <p>A career coach wont:</p> <p></p><ul><li>Get you a job<br></li><li>Be free</li></ul><p></p> <h3>Can a coach get you a job?</h3> <p>The short answer to that question is ""no."" A good coach, however, can give you the tools and the self-confidence to help you identify the right job, as well as help you find the shortest, most effective path to getting hired. </p> <h3>Will an executive coach get you an executive job?</h3> <p>Executive coaches specialize in helping corporate employees work their way up the proverbial company ladder. There are, however, some exceptions. For example, a good executive coach may help you realize that youre not only on the wrong rung, but youre also on the wrong ladder altogether. By analyzing the good and the bad elements of your professional life, you and your coach can determine whether or not youre in the right company or even in the right industry. </p> <h3>Does a career coach help everyone?</h3> <p>A coach can advise you, but ultimately youll still have to temper your ambitions with a heavy dose of reality. For example, if youve always wanted to quit work and open up a hot air balloon business, then a career counselor can help you figure out how you can do this and may even give you the encouragement you need. If you dont have the financial capital, youll still need to hang on to your current job for a bit longer. Your coach isnt going to make miracles happen. </p> <p>Many coaches come with accreditation from groups, such as the <a href=""http://www.coachfederation.org/"">International Coach Federation</a>, so talk to your coach about his or her credentials. As with any type of mentoring experience, people occasionally <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2012/03/07/when-career-coaching-is-a-waste-of-your-money/"">report bad experiences</a> with their career counselors, but this could be because of factors such as inexperience on the coachs part or simply a lack of chemistry and understanding between coach and client.</p> <p>If youre interested in hiring a career coach, the best thing you can do is get recommendations. Talk to friends and colleagues, research websites and get as many professional references as you can. By doing a bit of homework and keeping an open mind, you can find a coach who can help you get your career moving in the right direction.</p>"Resumes,What to Leave Out of a Cover Letter,"<h1><b>What to Leave Out of a Cover Letter</b></h1><p></p><p>A good cover letter spotlights a candidates strengths and how he or she would fit into an organization. Unfortunately, too many applicants fail to write a good cover letter, which generally can be attributed to these three reasons:</p><p></p><ul><li>They dont include enough information.<br></li><li>They include too much information.<br></li><li>They dont include the right kind of information.<br></li></ul><p></p><p>Making these mistakes can lead to few or no job interviews, which will harm your career prospects. To improve your chances of getting a phone call from an employer, learn what to leave out of a cover letter. </p><h3><b>Generic Language</b></h3><p>A cover letter is not simply a one-paragraph statement of your interest in a position. It is a place for you to sell your qualifications to an employer. To do this, you need to write a unique cover letter for each job for which you are applying. <a href=""http://ucs.yalecollege.yale.edu/content/cover-letters"">Yale College</a> recommends that you explain how your experience meets the qualifications of the job and how your skills could benefit the organization. This is also a good opportunity for you to show your knowledge of the company, a move that always impresses a hiring manager.</p><h3><b>Excessive Wordiness</b></h3><p>Corporate recruiting strategist<a href=""http://www.ere.net/2013/05/20/why-you-cant-get-a-job-recruiting-explained-by-the-numbers/"">John Sullivan</a>says that a company receives an average of 250 resumes for every job opening. Hiring managers do not have time to read all the cover letters that are included, and they appreciate ones that that are short and to the point. If you send a cover letter that exceeds one page, it is more likely to end up in the trash bin rather than in the potential interview pile.</p><h3><b>Summarizing the Resume</b></h3><p>In<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/sethporges/2012/08/29/6-secrets-to-writing-a-great-cover-letter/"">Forbes</a>, veteran writer Seth Porges says that many people mistakenly assume that a cover letter is just a repeat of the resume in letter form. Because the employer already has a copy of your resume, summarizing it will not improve your chances of getting an interview. Porges recommends that you use the cover letter to show your personality and knowledge of the field and the company for which you are applying. You can choose to reference an experience or event listed on your resume, but do so only to explain how that that event provided you with the skills or experience that would make you a better candidate for the position.</p><h3><b>Talking About College</b></h3><p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/08/cover_letter_writing_advice_how_to_write_a_cover_letter_for_an_entry_level.html"">Katherine Goldstein</a>, innovations editor for <i>Slate</i>, has reviewed hundreds of resumes and cover letters during her tenure with the online magazine. One of her biggest pet peeves is when the cover letter talks about college, especially after the applicant has graduated. Like most employers, she is only interested in experience that will help her company. Goldsteins advice is that if youre not currently a student, do not mention your GPA, your Ivy League education, your college coursework or your senior thesis in your cover letter. And definitely do not attach a chapter of the thesis to your application.</p><h3><b>Not Following Instructions</b></h3><p>When Goldstein posts job openings, she frequently includes specific instructions for applying to the position. She does this, in part, to gauge respondents ability to follow instructions and see how detail-oriented they are. If they fail to follow instructions to the letter, they may be disqualified. To avoid having your cover letter and resume thrown in the reject pile, Goldstein recommends that you read the submission instructions very carefully and follow them.</p>"Interviews,What You Don't Have to Say During a Job Interview,"<h1><b>What You Dont Have to Say During a Job Interview</b></h1><p>As you prepare to answer tough job interview questions, you should know that you don't have to answer them all. That's because some are illegal for the interviewer to ask. If an interviewer asks you, more often than not by accident, about any of the following details, consider your answer carefully. Formulate a response that relates to your qualifications for job, and leave out personal details that could lead to discrimination during the hiring process.</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Age</b>: According to this handy piece in<a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/careers/resources/interviewillegal.htm"">USA Today</a>, the interviewer only needs to know if you are over the age of 18. You can answer this question, but you do not have to reveal your exact age or birth date. You do not even have to say when you graduated from college, since this is a sneaky way to estimate your age.</li><li><b>Health and disabilities</b>: All that should matter is that you are able to complete the duties of the job. While interviewers can ask if you can lift a certain amount of weight and reach a specific height, they are not allowed to ask how much you weigh, how tall you are or if you have had any recent illnesses or surgeries. The only time they can inquire about these details is after you are offered the job, at which point they will have to make reasonable accommodations for you.<br></li><li><b>Language and nationality</b>: It might seem like a harmless question when interviewers ask you if they detect a foreign accent, but this is getting into dangerous territory. Thats because, according to <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/11-illegal-interview-questions-2013-7?op=1"">Business Insider</a>, they are not allowed to ask about your country of origin or native language. You only have to say you are eligible to work in the U.S., and then you can ignore more specific questions of this nature.<br></li><li><b>Debt</b>: Business Insider reports that employers need to have your express permission to find out about your credit history. At that point, they will probably just run a credit check rather than ask about it during the interview, so do not feel pressured to answer direct questions about your credit record or amount of debt.<br></li><li><b>Arrest record</b>: Interviewers can legally ask if you have been convicted of a crime that relates to the position for which you are interviewing. But that doesnt mean they can ask for all the details about your arrest record. So if the job would entail driving, they can ask if you have a DUI on your record, but this question would not be appropriate during an interview for a copy-writing position.<br></li><li><b>Religion</b>: It is illegal to ask about religion, and you can refuse to answer any questions about it. The only thing interviewers need to know is if you have any limitations that would affect your job, such as your willingness to work on Sundays. If this question is asked, feel free to answer honestly, leaving out any mention of your religion.<br></li><li><b>Marital status</b>: Interviewers are not supposed to come right out and ask if you are married or have kids, but they can ask questions about whether you would be willing to travel or work overtime. Be honest when you answer this question, but keep in mind that the job interview is not the time to mention that you would need to make childcare arrangements in advance. There will be plenty of time to determine these details once you get the job.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p>"Resumes,"When in Doubt, Use a Chronological Resume","<div><div><h2>When in Doubt, Use a Chronological Resume</h2></div></div><p>The chronological resume is the most basic of all resumes. It's simple, easy to put together and easy to understand. It lists your employment history in chronological orderthat is, by the dates in which each job was held. Starting with the most recent job at the top of the page, the chronological resume lists the jobs you have held from the most recent to the least recent.</p><p>The purpose of the chronological resume is twofold. First, it allows potential employers to see your career progression and gauge your movement through a particular industry. Second, it shows diversity in terms of jobs held. This type of resume is well suited to young job-seekers as well as older workers looking for a career change. </p><h3><b>Sections of a Chronological Resume</b></h3><div><b>Name and contact details</b></div><p>At the top of your resume, write your name and contact details, such as your telephone number, email address and mailing address. Each of these details enables a potential employer to contact you for an interview and also shows them that you live in the right area for the job. </p><b>Skills and abilities</b><div><p>Skills and abilities are the characteristics you have that are useful for employment. ""Detail-oriented,"" ""excellent computer skills,"" ""typing speed of 60 words per minute"" and ""independent"" are all examples for this section. Also include important technical certifications.</p><b>Employment history</b><div><p>Employment history is where you list your past jobs in chronological order. Start with the most recent job to make it easier for a potential employer to understand where you are in your career. If the list is long, you many want to consider a targeted chronological resume, which highlights only the most important or impressive jobs you have held. <br></p><p><b>Education </b><br></p><p>For young job seekers, it is acceptable to list either the school you currently attend or the high school from which you graduated. The same is true of college or university attendees or recent graduates. Always include the highest level of education that you have completed. For college educations, list ""Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology from Athabasca University,"" for example, instead of both ""Athabasca University.""<br></p><p>If you did not attend a university, list the relevant courses or training you have received. <br></p><b>Volunteer and other work</b><p>This is the section where you can show your interests and affiliations and signal your devotion to community or ability to self-motivate. List things like Humane Society volunteering, leading a Cub Scout troop or Tough Mudder competitions.</p><div><b>References</b></div><div><p>The references section should list two or three people who can vouch for your work ethic. These people can be ex-bosses, current supervisors, coworkers and teachers but not family and friends. List someone who is a professional.</p><p>When in doubt, use a chronological resume. It's a format that hiring managers are used to.</p></div></div></div>"Job Search Tips,Where to Find Job Salaries,"<h1>Where to Find Job Salaries</h1><p>Job salaries used to be closely guarded secrets, and until recently, it was nearly impossible to make systematic comparisons between two different career paths or between salary levels for the same job in two geographic regions. Now, however, salary information is abundant, and you can do a variety of statistical searches. Here are some of the best places to find good in-depth information:</p><h3>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</h3><p>The <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/bls/blswage.htm"">BLS</a> is part of the U.S. Department of Labor and is responsible for gathering and sharing all kinds of statistics related to the countrys workforce. The most useful entry point into this massive storehouse of information is the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/"">Occupational Outlook Handbook</a>. From this main page, you can choose among occupation groups and click on the one that covers the job in which youre interested. You will land on a page with a summary of basic information for all the jobs in that group. Clicking on an individual job title brings you to a page focused on that single job, offering a range of detailed information. This information includes current salary figures and projected growth in the field in the next 10 years, as well as a lot of other relevant information. </p>The advantage of this federal website is that it gathers huge quantities of information, since it has access to statistics kept by the IRS and Department of Labor. The downside of the BLS website is its massive bureaucratic tradition; although its mandate is to provide information to the public, the sites sheer size and complexity make it cumbersome.<h3>Simply Hired</h3><div>Simply Hireds ""<a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/salaries.html"">Simply Salary</a>"" page gathers data from all of the millions of job listings that its search engine compiles. This salary calculator allows you to enter skills as well as job titles, which allows for a broad, organic form of research. The results page explains how the average salary was arrived at, and then lists a collection of jobs with titles related to your search terms . On the right side of the page is a ""trends"" link, where you can access a visual graph of salary levels over the past year. Simply Hired also narrows searches down by location and allows users to shift their search from ""salaries"" to ""jobs."" <br><h3>Glassdoor</h3><p><a href=""http://www.glassdoor.com"">Glassdoor</a> is a career community. It provides inside information generated by people who actually work at the company you search for, so you can see reports from current employees on all sorts of workplace issues. You can search for salaries for a given job title, profession or company and narrow your search down by region. Based on ratings from current workers, Glassdoor has features such as ""Top 25 Companies to Work for"" and ""Top Companies for Work-Life Balance."" Applying the power of user reviews to rank employers helps tilt the power balance in the direction of the worker.</p><h3>Salary.com</h3><p>This site offers a ""<a href=""http://salary.com/category/salary/"">U.S. Salary Wizard</a>,"" which allows you to search for job salaries either by category or income level, integrated with a particular region. It does not allow searches by company, as Glassdoor does, but it does offer the functionality of a special paid personal salary report. This report is customized according to multiple variables and is intended to help you with negotiating a current or future salary.</p><h3>PayScale</h3><p><a href=""http://payscale.com"">PayScale</a> offers the same ability to search for a particular job function and location, and it puts special focus on trending statistics, offering reports on trends indexed by city, industry, company or job category. PayScale also offers a number of additional features, including a ""Cost of Living"" calculator and a ranking of colleges according to the pay levels of their graduates.</p><p>These resources allow you to conduct your job search confidently, armed with all the information you could possibly need on job salaries in your field.</p></div>"Job Search Tips,Why You Should Use Job Finder Alerts,"<h1><b>Why You Should Use Job Finder Alerts</b></h1> <p></p> <p>In todays competitive job market, job seekers need to cover all bases. This often means looking at job boards every day for hours to scour new job postings and apply for them as they become available. There is a way we think you should know about that lets you stay on top of job postings while saving time. Job finder alerts simplify the entire job search process, and they can be used to ensure that dont miss out on new listings.</p> <p></p> <p>There are several reasons why job finder alerts benefit for job seekers.Lets take a look at why you need to be incorporating this tool into your job search.</p><h3><b>Job alert options</b></h3><p></p><p>Most job sites such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> give job seekers an option to set up email job alerts based on keywords. For example, if you want to find a job as an accountant, you can set up your alert to find new jobs with this keyword in a specific geographic region. We advise setting up more than one alert if you think that hiring managers will post a job you are interested in under different titles.</p><p></p><p>Another way to monitor new job postings, particularly if a site doesnt offer alerts, is to use<a href=""http://www.google.com/alerts"">Google Alerts</a>. This is a free tool that allows you to input your desired keywords. Youll get an email whenever new pages are posted that contain your set keywords.</p><p>Important: <a href=""http://help.business.uconn.edu/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=178"">set your email filters</a> once you have your alerts in place. If you use Gmail, you can label and prioritize your alerts so that they'll be the first things you see. No matter what email client you use, creating filters or adding each service's email address to your address book will help ensure that your job alerts don't end up in your spam folder.</p> <p></p> <h3><b>Stand out from the crowd</b></h3> <p></p> <p>Two things that help job seekers compete are 1.) how quickly they respond to a job posting and 2.) whether or not their skill set is a good match for the position. By targeting the jobs you are qualified to do with a job finder alert, youre going to get a list that is tailored to your skill set, and you will receive it in real time. Youll be among the first to know about a new job and can apply before other candidates do. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Make your job search more efficient</b></h3> <p></p> <p>Using a job finder alert is like having a virtual recruiter help you find a new job. As the alerts come in, you can respond to the job postings in which you are interested. This is a much more efficient way to search, rather than wading through numerous job listings just to find one that might be a good fit for you. </p> <p></p> <p>One more tip: Its a good idea to create a <a href=""http://www.wa.gov/esd/guides/jobsearch/strategy/strat_tips.htm"">tracking database</a> of the jobs you respond to from your alerts. This will give you the ability to easily see where youve sent your resume, and you can keep track of the responses you receive.</p> <p></p>"Resumes,Write a Proper Resume Objective,"<h2>Write a Proper Resume Objective</h2><p>The first impression your resume makes might be that youre obsolete. If youre using your resume objective to describe your wish list, then youre missing your first chance to sell yourself. Dont make this classic mistake.</p><h3>Propose a new purpose</h3><h3><p>According to<a href=""http://rockportinstitute.com/resumes/"">Rockport Institute author Nicholas Lore</a>, ""The resume is a tool with one specific purpose: to win an interview."" You should focus on that one thing. Your resume sells you to your prospective employer with that one goal in mind. The resume gets you an interviewor not. Thats it. Thats the best and only thing your resume can accomplish.<br></p></h3><h3>The classic objective</h3><p>Old-fashioned resumes used the objective section to describe what the job seeker wanted from their new position. The theory was that by describing the work they desired, they revealed whatkind of employee they were; however, nowadays it reveals that theyre more interested in themselves than their prospective employers.According to <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2013/01/15/resumes-101-swap-a-stale-objective-for-a-fresh-branding-statement"">Arnie Fertig of U.S. News</a>, ""These days, any resume reader assumes that their job is your objective."" Talking about anything else you might want just wastes their time.</p><p>To insert a contemporary twist on a classic objective, you might want to try something like this:</p><p>""Highly motivated, future IT graduate seeks temporary internship providing hands-on training in troubleshooting hardware and software technologies.""</p><h3>Branding yourself</h3><p>Here's another thought.<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeromeyoung/2011/06/27/how-to-write-a-resume-summary-section-that-gets-interviews/"">Forbes contributor Jerome Young</a> advises job seekers to skip the objective statement. ""Instead,"" Young says, ""you should use the opening section of your resume to summarize what makes you a good fit for an open position.""You do this by branding yourself as a viable candidate for the position you want. Fertig recommends focusing on your attributes, your value and your uniqueness. Young says CEASE is the way to go: characteristics, experience, achievements, skills and expertise.</p><p>Always start with the targeted position in mind. A good job advertisement will tell you what a prospective employer is looking for in their next hire. The company website will tell you what the advertisement doesnt. When you visit the website, youre looking for keywords, just like youd enter into a search engine. You want to choose the keywords that best describe what you have to offer. You want to state your value clearly and succinctly using some of the keywords that appear on the company's website. This brands you as the right person for this specific position.</p><p>To brand yourself as the solution to a prospective employer's problem, you should try something like this:</p><p>""Results-driven IT professional with over 30 years experience applying information technologies in a healthcare setting seeks to utilize IS expertise to support the operation and strategic objectives of a growing and progressive healthcare organization.""</p><h3>Write Persuasively</h3><p>Youre creating an advertisement, so write persuasively. Active words are best; present tense is essential. In todays ""buyers market,"" job seekers are an overabundant commodity. In order to make the cut for that interview, you need to prove that youre more than a commodity. You must show that you are a uniquely appropriate fit for the work they need done.</p><p>Dont just write a resume objective. Prove your value by writing a clear message that shows you have their needs in mind. You know you can deliver. If you can prove that, then your resume can land you an interview. From there, its all up to you.</p>"Resumes,Where to Find Free Resumes,"<h1><b>Where to Find Free Resumes, for Print and Digital</b></h1> <p>When starting the hunt for a new job, nothing is as important as having a great resume.

As<a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-51344044/government-jobs-how-to-get-them/"">CBS News Moneywatch</a>so aptly put it, ""a government job can offer long-term rewards or a great place to ride out the downturn.""</p><h3>Diverse opportunities</h3><p>You might think of the government as one enormous monolith, with thousands of employees working away in cubicles. Actually, government employment is divided up among so many departments and agencies that there's a chance you could find work in a field interests you. Love nature and being outside? You can work for the National Parks Service and spend your days (and nights) out in the forest or the desert. Want to do research to end childhood cancer? Apply for a job at the National Institutes of Health. Browse through <a href=""http://bestplacestowork.org/BPTW/index.php"">The Best Places to Work</a>, a government site that publishes rankings and reviews on its own employee satisfaction levels.</p><h3>Fair employment practices</h3><p>Government work offers a sanctuary from the subjective and secretive pay practices of the business world. Each government position has a title and a pay grade, and you can look these up on a <a href=""http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2012/general-schedule/2012-gs-annual-rates-by-grade-and-step/"">public chart</a>. Public employers at the state, county and city levels have similar open pay practices. Also, the public hiring process is bound by a number of equal opportunity employment laws, so if you belong to an under-represented minority group, you will not encounter discrimination. </p><h3>Job security and financial stability</h3><p>In addition to the regulations governing fair hiring practices, government jobs have a complex set of procedures in place to protect workers from arbitrary dismissal. Paul Light, a professor of public service at New York University, was quoted by <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2007/sep/05/mcain-federal/"">Politifact </a>as saying, ""Very few federal employees...are ever fired on the basis of poor performance."" Many politicians have pointed this fact out, but as John Palguta of the Partnership for Public Service explains, ""It's not supposed to be easy to fire federal workers for the wrong reasons.""</p><p>While federal salaries are roughly equivalent or in excess of the private sector on many levels, according to <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2012/11/14/5-tips-for-getting-a-government-job/"">Forbes</a>, the health care benefits and pension plans for government jobs are generally better than what is possible in the private sector except at the highest levels. The American Enterprise Institute did a <a href=""http://www.aei-ideas.org/2011/09/how-generous-are-federal-employee-pensions/"">comparative analysis</a>thatshowed that a public sector worker ends up with pension benefits that pay more than twice the annual rate of those earned by a similar worker in the private sector.</p>"Career,Everything You Need to Know about Working in Construction,"<h1>Everything You Need to Know about Working in Construction</h1><p>Job openings for construction workers are increasing by<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/construction-laborers-and-helpers.htm#tab-1"">25 percent</a>, according to the federal government, and the current pay rate averages a median $13.66 an hour.

If you want to work in construction, but aren't sure what requirements you have to meet or what titles you must hold, keep reading.</p><h3>Job information</h3><p>Aconstruction worker is any skilled worker or unskilled tradesmen who falls under the following categories:</p><p></p><ul><li>Carpenter</li><li>Electrician</li><li>Mason</li><li>Ironworker</li><li>Heavy construction machinery operator</li><li>Sheet metal worker</li><li>Plasterer</li><li>Plumber</li><li>Welder</li><li>Steel fixer</li></ul><p></p><p>Construction workers construct building materials and piping as well as buildings and other structures. They work indoors and outdoors and must wear protective gear to keep them safe from hazards.</p><p>Most construction workers use heavy machinery or electric tools that require training to use. This training can be given on the job. However, with large construction companies, training received in an educational setting is often required. Depending on what job a construction worker seeks, permits or licenses may also be required.</p><h2>Qualifications and Requirements</h2><p>In order to work in construction, you may be required to meet certain educational and training requirements. These requirements are set by both companies and the government and vary by state. In addition to these requirements, construction workers must also produce proof that they can work in the U.S. Some companies have hired undocumented immigrants in the past, but this practice currently is illegal. Below are some of the requirements you might need in order to work in construction.</p><h3>Educational requirements</h3><p>You don't have to meet any specific educational requirements to become a construction worker. However, if you wish to work for a large company, you may be required to show a trade certificate.</p><p>Here is an incomplete list of jobs requiring certification (for additional information or specific requirements see the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag23.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> website):</p><p></p><ul><li>Rough Terrain Forklift Operator</li><li>Scaffold User and Builder</li><li>Welder</li><li>Signal Person Qualification</li><li>Construction Site Manager</li><li>Carpenter</li><li>Steel Worker</li><li>Iron Worker</li><li>Electrician</li><li>Brick Mason</li></ul><div>Educational experience can lead to advancement opportunities, more complex duties and higher pay.</div><p></p><h3>Physical requirements</h3><div>Construction workers are expected to lift and work with heavy materials.

This means physical strength is important.Stamina is also important. Construction workers often work in direct heat and cold for hours on end. You must have the stamina to push, pull and lift heavy items for many hours in uncomfortable temperatures.</div><h3>Training and licensing</h3><p>If you're planning to work with gas lines, electricity or water, you may need a license for those jobs as well. License requirements differ from state to state. If you're planning to work with or around those previously listed items, contact your state licensing agency for information. In addition, you will be required to obtain a federal Hazmat license if you're working with hazardous materials.<br></p><p>Some companies shortcut these requirements and ask employees to work without licenses.

After all, <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/08/20/small-business-hiring/2662407/"">USA Today</a>reports there is job growth at small companies, with available jobs totaling 82,000. If you are not sure whether you should work at a small business, here are four advantages of doing so. <br></p> <h3>You can get to know your boss </h3> <p>In a large corporation, you might never meet or get to know the owner of the business. When you work for a smaller company, though, it is likely you will see the owner on a regular basis and get to know him or her. According to <a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226176"">Entrepreneur</a>, more than half of the people who participated in a 2012 poll think of small business owners as honest and ethical. Getting to know the person is power can benefit you even after you move on to another job. <br></p> <h3>You'll take on many roles at a small business </h3> <p>When you work for a smaller company, your job title doesn't limit you like it may at a major corporation. That means that if youre a bookkeeper who also happens to be good at designing logos, you could do some side projects involving graphic design when the business needs your expertise. The main advantage here is that you can build your resume, which may help you land a job in graphic design if you decide to change careers. Also, depending on the number of roles and responsibilities you are given, you might end up learning about every aspect of a business so you can eventually start your own company with confidence. <br></p> <h3>You're a big fish in a little pond </h3> <p>You probably hear this phrase often because it's true. According to the <a href=""http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/sme.htm"">University of Kent</a>, when there are not very many employees and you are doing a good job, you will stand out. This can lead to more frequent promotions, raises or awards at work. If you enjoy being recognized for your hard work, a small business is probably a better place for you than a large company. <br></p> <h3>You can expect to see the results of your hard work </h3> <p>When you work for a corporation, you play a very small role in most projects, so it is hard to see the impact you are making. With a small business, you might take on a project on your own or with only a few other people. Once it is completed, you are able to see the fruits of your labor quite clearly. <br></p> <p>This could be why the <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2012/10/16/are-you-happy-at-work/"">Wall Street Journal</a> reported on a poll that working for a small business with fewer than 100 employees makes you 25 percent more likely to be happy at work.

This field is constantly developing, offering both challenging work and good pay, and as a result it has become quite popular. There are a variety of pathways to becoming an IT professional. The common theme among them: adaptability and the ability to keep up with cutting edge technology.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Most IT jobs require a bachelors degree in a relevant branch of technology. Its worth spending time simply reading through college catalogs and websites to get acquainted with all the various IT-related fields of study that exist. Some of these majors might be unfamiliar to you because theyre being revised and updated continually. At <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/dept/uga/academic/programs/engineering.html"">Stanford</a>, for example, its possible to major in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence, biocomputation, programming methodology or programming abstractions. Majors in electrical engineering include: electronics, computer systems, information theory, bioelectrical engineering and green electrical engineering.</p><h3>IT Support Positions</h3><p>These positions are more entry level and their educational requirements are modest. The Bureau of Labor Statistics page for<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-support-specialists.htm"">Computer Support Specialists</a> notes that a college degree is not required for this type of position. The field is expected to grow by 18 percent in the coming decade. This job category includes various types of technical support roles within a wide range of industries, and in most cases, on-the-job training is offered for each companys specialized equipment.</p><h3>Independent Work<br></h3><p>It's possible to create a unique pathway into the IT world by putting your skills to work from home on your own time. There are two different approaches to independent work: Hire yourself out as a freelancer or create and sell your own product.</p><p>Freelance work can be as simple as registering and picking up assignments from a platform such as<a href=""https://www.odesk.com/"">Odesk</a>,<a href=""null"">Elance</a>or even your local <a href=""http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites"">Craigslist.</a> (Check the ""gigs"" section.) If you want to take your freelance work to the next level, create an online business presence with a slick website and a social media marketing campaign.</p><p>If you prefer the potential for much higher income and you don't mind investing long hours, developing and marketing your own app is another option. Over 235,000 developers have successfully sold their apps through Apple, and <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/tristanlouis/2013/08/10/how-much-do-average-apps-make/"">Forbes</a> found that the average freelance developer makes about $4,000 per app that he or she markets through Apple. Some apps, of course, strike a sweet spot and bring in far more money, but it's important to know that this new type of entrepreneurship is definitely <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/business/as-boom-lures-app-creators-tough-part-is-making-a-living.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"">a bit of a gamble</a>. <br></p><h3>Internships</h3><p>With many IT jobs, the technology moves faster than any college curriculum, so internships are a crucial piece of becoming marketable in this field. By taking an internship with an IT company, you will have the opportunity to engage with professionals at a level that is not possible for many students. Internships put you on the inside of current developments in a specific technology and keep you up to date on cutting-edge innovations. Internships can be found on dedicated internship directory websites or on general job board websites like <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/k-information-technology-jobs.html"">Simply Hired</a>.</p><p>One last piece of advice: Go where the jobs are. Every organization in every city needs IT on some level, but the real action is happening in Northern California, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and the Puget Sound region in Washington State.</p>"Job Search Tips,How to Find Local Jobs,"<h1><b>How to Find Local Jobs</b></h1> <p align=""center""><b></b></p> <p>Many job seekers would prefer to find a job in their local area, close to wherever they call home. Depending on the size of your town, the new methods of finding of a job online and through social media <a href=""http://jobsearch.about.com/od/findajob/qt/localjob.htm"">may not always work</a>. However, there are plenty of ways to find local jobs that involve a mix of online searching, glad-handing and shoe leather. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Network within your community</b></h3> <p></p> <p>This is perhaps the best way to get a job in your community. If you arent already a part of your community--your town, place of worship or local school--then this is the time to start getting involved. Attend local business networking events. Take some time to volunteer. Youll meet influential people who will be able to assist you in your job search.</p> <p></p> <p>The best way to network to find a job is to subtly let it be known that youre looking for a new job. Let your attitude and your work ethic do the rest of the talking. If people see that you would be a good employee, and youre not hounding them to find you a job, chances are they will be more apt to help you find work. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Utilize online job sites</b></h3> <p></p> <p>Some online job sites are still useful for local job seekers, particularly if you are in an industry that utilizes websites and social media. Set email job alerts with your favorite online job sites such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> to help alert you when a new job in your area is posted.This technique is going to help expand your local job search. Never assume that just because youre in a small town that employers arent using the Internet to post jobs. Check the profiles of local businesses on Facebook and Twitter. They may be posting their job openings on social media. Your state probably offers a jobs website as well.</p> <p></p> <h3><b>Traditional job postings</b></h3> <p></p> <p>Sometimes the traditional way of finding a job still works best for <a href=""http://www.kckcc.edu/services/studentServices/careerPlanningAndPlacement/generalInformation/activeVsTraditionalJobSearchMethods.aspx"">local job seekers</a>, particularly in small towns. Look through your local newspapers, pay attention to your local radio stations and check out any community sites, bulletin boards or newsletters that are available. Many employers use these means to find new employees.</p><p> Another way to find a job in your area is to go to businesses that youre interested in working for and introduce yourself. Some businesses dont do much when it comes to actively looking for new candidates, but they will post help wanted notices in the window or inside at the main desk. </p> <p></p> <p>No matter what industry youre in, finding local jobs can take time. The key is to stay positive and keep looking. If you dont have a job right now, volunteering can help you network and get out of the house. This will help you maintain a more positive attitude. Plus, you can fill this gap in your resume with good deeds, which hiring managers tend to look kindly upon.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"Resumes,Write a Functional Resume,"<h1>Write a Functional Resum</h1>Your resum is your admission ticket to interviews and eventually getting hired for the job you want. If you are changing careers, re-entering the workforce after a long absence or have a very long work history, you should consider using a functional resum rather than a chronological one. Functional resums give prospective employers a clearer picture of your relevant work history, your skills and your abilities. <div><div><h3>Focus on your skills</h3><p>Unlike a chronological resum, which focuses on your work experience, a <a href=""http://writing.colostate.edu/guides/documents/resume/functionalSample.pdf"">functional resum</a> focuses on your skill set. You should include a ""Skills"" section near the top of the resum. In this section, list specific skills you possess that are relevant to the type of position you're seeking. It's best to use headings and bullet points in this section. For example, you might list ""Research Skills"" as one of your skill sets, then in bullet points list online research in specific medical databases, lab research and researching articles in scientific journals.</p><h3>Include relevant work experience</h3><p>Just because your resum is functional doesn't mean you should leave out work experience. The trick is to choose the most relevant experience. Instead of describing the work in detail, make a list of jobs in reverse chronological order. Don't worry about gaps in employment. The purpose of creating a functional resum is to provide employers with the most relevant experiences. If there are gaps, they won't be as obvious as they would be on a chronological resum; your prospective employer will assume you didn't include less relevant experiences.</p></div><div>To determine which work experiences to include, ask yourself these questions in relation to the job for which you're applying:</div><div><ul><li>How relevant are the skills I used on this job?</li><li>How relevant is the title of this position?</li><li>How recent is this position?</li></ul><p>It's best to include recent experiences whenever possible, especially in industries that have seen a lot of changes. For example, if you're going for an IT job, experience from the 1970s or 1980s will not be pertinent except as part of a longer list, as technology has changed.</p></div><h3>Include education</h3><p>Employers want to see your education. Include relevant degrees at the bottom of the resum in reverse chronological order. Include continuing education courses. Taking recent courses related to your industry is more important than a degree that isn't recent or relevant, although you will want to include your degree if you're required to have one for the position.</p><h3>Keep it short</h3><p>Keep your resum to less than one page if you can. Long resums may never be seen. If your resum is too long, examine it with an eye towards keeping only the most relevant data.</p><div>Writing a functional resum is different than a chronological resume, but if you are in the midst of a career transition it can be a real asset. By putting only the most relevant information on your resum, you can often increase your chances of landing your next job.</div></div>"Career,Where Are the Health Care Jobs?,"<h1>Where are the Health Care Jobs?</h1><p>Health care is a secure sector of the economy in which to plan a career. The need for health care workers will only increase as baby boomers age, and health care jobs are difficult to outsource to other parts of the world. One out of every eight jobs in the United States is related to health care, according to the <a href=""http://www.seiu.org/healthcare-jobs/"">Service Employees International Union</a>. Here are a few growing health care jobs to consider:</p><h3>Nursing</h3><p>U.S. News ranks the <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-healthcare-jobs"">top 10 health care jobs</a> each year according to salary, number of openings and opportunity for advancement. <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/registered-nurse"">Registered Nurse</a>is No. 2 job on that list, (after dentists) because of the enormous variety of settings in which nurses can work as well as the solid economic prospects for these opportunities in the coming decade. Nurses are needed in high-tech urban hospitals and small town clinics, in schools and nursing homes, cruise ships and county public health offices. </p><h3>Physical and occupational therapy</h3><p>With a projected growth of 39 percent in the coming decade, physical therapy is a promising career choice. One reason this field is expected to show explosive growth is the fact that a large segment of the U.S. population is becoming elderly, and physical therapists play a major role in helping older people stay active and mobile. The median salary for an occupational therapist is $73,820. For job seekers with less time to invest in professional education, the position of physical therapy assistant is also in the top 10, and these professionals have many of the same duties and perks as full-fledged physical therapists.</p><h3>Dental hygiene and dental assisting</h3><p>Dental care is a financially rewarding field that is expected to grow vigorously over the next decade. Dental hygienists tend to work part-time, and many people enter this field with a two-year post-secondary degree. Dental offices also need dental assistants. They have less specialized skills but usually enjoy the same flexible part-time schedule as dental hygienists. The median salary for dental hygienists is $69,280 and for dental assistants is $34,140.</p><h3>Technologists and technicians</h3>The Bureau of Labor Statistics lists 23 <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home.htm"">health care jobs</a>that require two years or less of college or professional training. Many of these jobs carry the title of ""technologist"" or ""technician,"" and as medical care becomes more complex, such functions are increasingly in demand. For example: Nuclear medicine technologists, radiologic technologists, surgical technologists, medical records technicians, pharmacy technicians.<div><br></div><div>The pathways to entering the health care field have never been more numerous.</div>"Career,Criminal Justice Careers,"<h1>Criminal Justice Careers</h1><p>If you like the idea of helping people by using the law, you might be interested in the field of criminal justice. When you think of this field, police officers, judges and prison guards often come to mind. While these are criminal justice jobs, not all of them are in high demand. If you are intent on entering a field of criminal justice that is growing, take a look at some of these careers. <br></p> <h3>Probation officer </h3> <p>As a probation officer, you would monitor criminals to make sure they do not commit additional crimes. Not only would you have to communicate with criminal offenders, but you would also have to stay up to date on their cases, which would require handling paperwork and keeping in contact with the court. If you think you can perform these tasks, and if you have a bachelor's degree - preferably in psychology, criminal justice or social work - you can become a probation officer. The <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/probation-officers-and-correctional-treatment-specialists.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> claims the growth rate of this career is 18 percent, with a median salary around $47,000. <br></p> <h3>Private detective </h3> <p>If you want an interesting career that makes use of your research skills, consider becoming a private detective. In this job, you will get the chance to do everything from finding missing people to performing background checks for large companies. The demand for private detectives is supposed to increase by about 21 percent by 2020. A college degree is not usually necessary but at least some college or experience conducting investigations can help you land a job. The median salary is about $43,000.</p><h3>Crime Scene Examiner</h3>If the idea of analyzing crime scenes for facts and clues sounds interesting to you, consider a career as a crime scene examiner. This position would require you to go out to crime scenes and carefully collect evidence, which you would then bring back to the lab for a closer look. If you have seen ""Dexter,"" it's sort of what Dexter does, only without the murderous vigilantism. If using science to find answers appeals to you, and if you have a bachelor's degree in forensic or natural science, then you are qualified. According to the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/forensic-science-technicians.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, this field should grow by about 20 percent by 2020, and you can expect to make around $52,000 annually. <h3>Criminal law attorney </h3> <p><a href=""http://work.chron.com/criminal-justice-jobs-demand-us-19419.html"">The Houston Chronicle</a> reports that attorneys willing to handle criminal law will continue to be in demand for years to come. Whether you become a defense attorney or a prosecutor, you will need a degree from law school in order to practice. In return, you can expect a salary of around $100,000 or more. <br></p> <h3>Paralegal </h3> <p>As a paralegal, you would help lawyers with their cases, often by preparing legal documents. In fact, many paralegals can do the same tasks as most lawyers, with the major difference being that they cannot practice law by themselves or present cases in court. So if you are interested in dealing with the law but lack the time or money for law school, you might consider this career. It is expected to grow by about 18 percent by 2020. This is one of the few criminal justice careers requiring just an associate's degree to start. You can expect to make around $47,000 annually in this position. </p>"Job Search Tips,Job Search Red Flags,"<h1>Job Search Red Flags<br></h1><div><p>Finding a job online can be difficult. Some job postings may not be what they seem, while others may be for jobs for that candidates have little chance of getting. If you're looking for a job, you need to know how to spot job search red flags so you don't waste time and effort on applications that won't get you anywhere.</p></div><h2>The job posting is very old</h2><div><p>If a job was posted three or more months ago, the chances are high that one of the following is true:</p></div><div><ul><li>The position has been filled, but the recruiter has neglected to remove the posting.</li><li>The recruiter has given up on the posting, but has not deleted it.</li><li>The job does not really exist.</li></ul><div><p>Online job boards are filled with people who are anxious to find jobs. Why would a position remain vacant for months and months? It's highly unlikely that a recruiter would have trouble finding the right person after three or more months.<br></p><h2>The same job has been posted several times</h2></div></div><div>If the same job listing was posted several months ago and several months before that, proceed with caution. Repeated job posts can mean several things:</div><div><ul><li>The job has a high turnover rate because of insufficient training, low pay or other problems</li><li>The recruiter made a technological error</li><li>The job search board is trying to inflate the number of openings it has.</li></ul><div>According to the <a href=""http://www.cluewagon.com/2009/08/5-reasons-the-employer-re-posted-the-ad/"">Clue Wagon blog</a>, recruiters sometimes re-post jobs because they're not good workplaces and people leave after just a month or two. Research, research, research to find out if a company has organizational problems.</div></div><h2>The listing doesn't state the company that's hiring<br></h2><div><p>If company information is confidential, you may want to think twice about applying.</p></div><div><ul><li>You have no way of researching the company ahead of time to see if you would really want to work there.</li><li>Sometimes--and this is rare--anonymous job listings are posted by resum collectors when there is no actual current job opening. If it looks super shady, avoid it.</li></ul><h2>The job posting lists a fax number</h2></div><div><p>If a job posting gives you a choice of fax or email, it may be legitimate. However, jobs that require you to fax your resum or other information may not be worth your time. Most modern businesses use email for job recruitment. If a business still relies solely on faxes, it is not using modern technology. Such a business may be difficult to work for. The only exception to this would be if a company expects a high volume of applicants and is using its fax request to weed out lazy job seekers. If it's your dream job, and this appears to be the case, then fax away.</p></div><h2>The job posting suggests you will be your own boss</h2><div><p>Beware of any job posting that states you will be your own boss or that you can make ""up to"" a large amount of money. If these job opportunities are legitimate, they usually involve making sales in order to receive a commission. Find out what your base pay is before pursuing such a job.</p></div><h2>The job posting tells you to submit sensitive information</h2><div><p>You should never be required to submit your Social Security Number or bank account information until you are hired. If a job posting asks you to submit this type of information right away, it is not legitimate. You should report these types of posts to the site you find them on so that they can be removed.</p></div><div><p>Don't apply indiscriminately to every job listing you see. Learn the job search red flags to watch for so you don't waste your time.</p></div>"Career,Find Good Part-Time Workers,"<h1><b>How to Find Good Part-Time Workers</b></h1><div>An increasing number of jobs are falling short of the standard full-time work week of 40 hours. Why? Hiring part-time workers saves money and increases flexibility for companies. Are there differences between hiring part-time workers and full-time workers? Yes, small but important ones.</div><h3>Finding part-time workers</h3><div><p>Recruiters target different demographics when hiring part-time rather than full-time employees. The part-time workforce tends to include young people juggling study and work, and it also includes working parents and older people approaching or in retirement. As a result, different approaches are needed to reach out to these potential candidates.</p></div><p>College students are often well-suited to part-time work. They have free time between classes, in the evenings and on weekends and are often looking for work during the busy summer season. The downside is that these young people often lack experience, so businesses must set aside time to train them. Although students cannot always provide references from previous employers, recruiters can ask to see references from teachers to get an idea of the student's reliability and character.</p><p>High school students are another option, but companies must be aware of child <a href=""http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/5-things-you-need-know-now-about-hiring-temporary-workers-2012-holiday-season"">labor laws</a>. Minors cannot legally work in hazardous roles, and there are strict limits on the number of hours that those under 16 can work. U.S. laws prevent 14- and 15-year-olds from working more than three hours on a school day, or eight hours a day on the weekend. Some states place additional restrictions on part-time work for teenagers.</p><p>Because many people seeking part-time work are among the young digital generation, advertising online is a good way to reach out to potential candidates. Job search engines such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> are convenient online venues to advertise an available position.</p><h3>Considerations when advertising and interviewing for for part-time positions</h3><p>Many job seekers see part-time work as temporary. Part-time jobs are often used to finance study or as a stopgap while looking for full-time employment. Businesses that require more stable part-timers should be clear when advertising as to whether they are looking for a permanent employee or one that can fill a <a href=""http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/workforce-management-hiring-consulting/1010-1.html"">seasonal position</a>.</p><p>Because many part-time job applicants are planning to balance the job with their other commitments, it's important to find out what their available hours are during the interview. Employers must remember not to ask illegal interview questions, such as inquiries about family life, age or childbearing plans. Interviewers can ask candidates about their career goals, the hours they are available each week and their motivations for applying to the job.</p><h3>Hiring Freelancers Instead of Employing Part-Time Workers</h3><div>Instead of taking on part-time workers as employees, many companies are outsourcing work to freelancers. A<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/jan/21/outsource-work-to-freelancers-online-sme"">2013 poll by The Guardian</a> found that 79 percent of business respondents regard freelancers as a key component of their business strategy. This is a very flexible option for the employer, and it can lead to stable, long-term contracts between freelancers and the companies they work for. Freelancers in almost every field can be found online; many of the top established freelancers have their own websites or LinkedIn profiles that outline their skills and experience. Try searching LinkedIn and <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> to find freelancers who have specific specialist skills.</div><h3>Rules governing part-time workers</h3><p>Many of the rights that apply to full-time staff also apply when hiring someone on a part-time basis. Before hiring part-time workers, employers should take the time to familiarize themselves with the rules regarding part-time worker rights.</p><div><ul><li>Part-time employees must be paid at least minimum wage.</li><li>Part-time workers are entitled to meal and rest breaks.</li><li>Part-timers may be entitled to benefits such as holiday pay if they work enough hours in the year to qualify.</li><li>Businesses are required to carry worker's compensation insurance for part-time staff.</li><li>Tax withholding rules apply to part-time workers, even if they are only seasonal employees</li></ul><div><p>Good part-time help is plentiful if you know where to look and treat your workers fairly.</p></div></div>"Interviews,How to Recruit on College Campuses,"<h1>How to Recruit on College Campuses</h1><p>When you want to hire younger workers who have an education, colleges are a great source. If you recruit on college campuses, you can attract bright, energetic candidates who are just entering your field. But not every company knows the ins and outs of recruiting on college campuses. Here are some tips.</p><h3>What do you have to offer?</h3><p>According to <a href=""http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/09/how-to-recruit-on-college-campuses.html#/guides/2010/09/how-to-recruit-on-college-campuses.html"">Evan Klonsky</a>, ""Companies, especially small and growing companies, should realize they are in a position to offer employees a lot of room to grow."" This is a key attribute thats going to help you attract top students from colleges near you. Instead of squeezing top candidates in at the bottom, offer candidates real responsibilities and follow through on these promises.</p><p>By recruiting on campus, you can network with local college students and attract young professional candidates. According to Klonsky, your biggest challenge may be making your organization attractive enough to compete for the candidates you most want to hire. Focusing on your strengths, advertising creatively, offering perks and using social media to your advantage are just a few of the things you can do to give your organization an edge.</p><h3>Working with the college</h3><p>Recruiting on campus requires some organization. According to <a href=""http://coe.berkeley.edu/corporate-relations/campus-recruiting.html"">Berkeleys School of Engineering</a>, the best place to start is the colleges Corporate Relations Office. Follow the colleges unique rules to maximize cooperation.</p><p><a href=""http://web.ccis.edu/en/Offices/CampusLife/CareerServices/OnCampusRecruiting.aspx"">Columbia College</a> lists detailed policies and procedures. If you follow them, you get access to their support staff, which can help you access students, provide a more inclusive applicant pool, pre-screen applicants whove expressed interest in your positions and extend offers for candidates to consider.</p><p><a></a>You may also want to reach out to the professors who teach the subject your candidates need to know. A positive relationship with well-placed professors could offer the insight you need to access the best candidates year in and out.</p><h3>Trial arrangements</h3><p>One of the advantages to recruiting on college campuses is the ability to create trial opportunities for candidates. By working with local universities to create internships that meet students needs, you can hire temporary employees who require less compensation while vetting them for future positions. This is a win-win opportunity that gives both you and your ideal candidates a chance to find the right fit before either of you makes a long-term decision.</p><p>A relationship with a college and its students, formed by an internship opportunity, will also give you more leverage when seeking the colleges cooperation in attracting their best and brightest students.</p><p>What students lack in bona fide experience they make up for in energy, enthusiasm and innovation. Theyre fresh out of college and apply what they have learned. Give them room to grow, and youll find that recruiting on college campuses can net you the types of rising stars every company needs.</p><p></p>"Career,Do College Majors Matter?,"<h1>Do College Majors Matter?<br></h1><p>In some fields, having a degree is essential. For example, you must study the law to be a lawyer. Likewise, if you intend to have a career as a geologist, majoring in geology is important. At the other end of the spectrum, a lot of college majors dont really set you up for a career in any distinct field. Majoring in English does not make becoming a successful author much easier. Many journalists didn't study journalism. Many small business owners do not have business degrees or MBAs. Lets take a look at how college majors affect employment, as well as careers that require specific majors and ones that dont.</p><h3>College majors and unemployment</h3><p>Does it really matter whether you majored in philosophy or art history once you graduate? Not directly. Few people actually manage to get paid to work in those fields. That doesnt mean time spent studying in college was wasted. The bulk of liberal arts majors learn skills that are essential to long-term success  things like creative thinking and effective communication. </p><p></p><p>Here's the problem with majoring in a subject that's not valuable to the market. Competition is actually higher for jobs that dont require specific majors. According to <a href=""http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/hpi/cew/pdfs/Unemployment.Final.update1.pdf"">a study</a> by Georgetown University, ""Majors that are more closely aligned with particular occupations and industries tend to experience lower unemployment rates.""</p><p>To illustrate this concept, consider these two scenarios: A recent college graduate earns a degree in accounting and takes the CPA exam. He or she will most likely apply for jobs in the accounting field requiring CPA certification. This graduate will compete only with candidates who also have their CPA licenses.<br></p><p>Now consider a second graduate who majored in philosophy and earned a bachelor's degree. This job-seeker will quickly find that getting a job in the philosophy field will most likely require at least a master's degree, if not a doctorate. He or she will then likely apply for general jobs that attract hundreds or even thousands of applicants all coming from various fields of study that have no straightforward career path. While this graduate may have some desirable skills that employers want, it will be harder to get noticed. The sheer number of applicants for each job will make landing a decent job much more difficult.<br></p><p></p><h3>Where college majors matter</h3><ul><li>Engineering</li><li>Healthcare</li><li>Physical sciences</li><li>Pharmacy science</li><li>Computer science</li><li>Education</li></ul><p>Not only is it usually easier to find a job with a major in a field that is associated with an occupation, but the pay is often much higher as well. With the exception of education, college students majoring in fields such as those mentioned above can also expect to earn significantly more than average. <br></p><h3>Where majors dont matter so much</h3><p>Unlike majors that lead to obvious careers, many liberal arts majors leave students with a wide range of options upon graduation. Higher education researcher <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/abby-miller/does-major-really-matter_b_2805741.html"">Abby Miller</a>highlights the benefits of these types of degrees: ""The original intent of a liberal arts degree is not to prepare you for a career, but rather to broaden your mind, and train you to analyze and communicate.""</p><p>While job seekers often complain about how hard it is to find decent jobs with a degree such as philosophy, recruiters tell a different story. Top employers actually seek out candidates who are creative, can think on their feet and have superb communication skills. </p><h3>Separate yourself from the pack</h3><p>While employers say they seek out graduates with liberal arts college majors, getting yourself in front of companies for an interview can be tough. In order to land top jobs, graduates must put their newly acquired collegiate skills to work in the job search phase. Just getting your resume noticed takes ingenuity. Those who find creative ways to leverage their network and make their resumes stand out do not lack for opportunities.</p><p></p><p></p><p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/abby-miller/does-major-really-matter_b_2805741.html""></a></p><p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/abby-miller/does-major-really-matter_b_2805741.html""></a></p>"Interviews,Job Post FAILs,"<h1><b>Job Post FAILs</b></h1><p>You have probably seen some pretty appalling and downright laughable resumes from job applicants. But even employers can make major mistakes when attempting to move forward the wheels of labor. Here are some examples of job post FAILs you should definitely avoid imitating. <br></p> <h3><b>Incredibly long posting with a single paragraph </b></h3> <p>When you take a look at a this job posting listed on <a href=""http://worstjobpostingsever.blogspot.com/2011/04/its-simple-really.html#more"">Worst Job Postings Ever</a>, you can immediately see the issue. The listing for Mobile Graphic Designer includes nearly 1,000 words with no separate sections, all in one paragraph! If you want anyone to read your ad, it should be somewhat appealing to the eye. You would not want to read a resume that was this long without several paragraphs and bullet points, so don't make job candidates do it, either. This block of text right here is about 100 words. Now multiply it times 10 with no breaks.<br></p> <h3><b>Not enough information </b></h3> <p>Another posting mentioned on <a href=""http://worstjobpostingsever.blogspot.com/2011/03/this-wins-prize-for-shortest-job-post.html"">Worst Job Postings Ever</a> has the opposite problem in that it is far too short. It simply says, ""Hygiene part time Thursday in a periodontal practice."" While most job applicants can probably assume what the job title is, the listing lacks an official job description, job requirements or any mention of salary. It definitely does not instill a sense of confidence in anyone who views the ad, as it does not look very professional. You might want to avoid that particular dental practice on Thursdays as well.<br></p> <h3><b>Nonsensical </b></h3> <p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/12/19-more-crazy-craigslist-ads_n_758718.html#slide=154307"">The Huffington Post</a> mentioned an ad that not only has too little information, but is also grammatically incorrect. It reads, ""We need a smart or more person to help un with our Company."" A post like this won't exactly attract the best applicants, if it gets any responses at all. If you are thinking of placing an ad like this, don't un with it.<br></p> <h3><b>Discriminatory </b></h3> <p>You think it would go without saying, but you should make sure your job posting is not discriminatory or illegal. Apparently at least one business in Australia is not aware of this. According to News Online from Australia (<a href=""http://www.news.com.au/business/your-business/no-indians-asians-job-advertisement-causes-outrage-coles/story-fn9evb64-1226459746133"">news.com.au</a>), a company had a job ad that mentioned, ""Store requires no indians or asians please. MUST SPEAK ENGLISH (sic)."" Obviously there was some backlash from the public, including a boycott and possibly even legal action. The business claimed a contract company it hired actually posted the ad, so another lesson from this job posting disaster is to only allow someone you trust to post job ads. <br></p> <h3><b>Unprofessional all around </b></h3> <p><a href=""http://www.trendingbuffalo.com/life/digital-finds/the-worst-job-posting-on-buffalo-craigslist-this-week/"">Trending Buffalo</a> dissected the many things wrong with one of the job post FAILs found on Craigslist. The ad was vague when it came to describing the job and what little was described seemed illegal. It also had typos and an unprofessional email address to boot. Overall, this ad is a great example of what NOT to do when you need to hire someone. If your job posting sounds or is illegal, it's always best to rewrite it.</p>"Job Search Tips,Avoid Jargon When Posting Jobs,"<div><h1>Avoid Jargon When Posting Jobs</h1></div><p>Getting the wording to job advertisements right helps attract candidates who can excel in the roles you intend to fill. Unfortunately, many job postings on online job boards are filled with jargon that does not communicate much about the position or the employer. By taking a little more time to carefully write job postings, rather than relying on overused jargon, recruiters can attract a better pool of applicants and avoid causing confusion.</p><h3>Jargon is off-putting</h3><p><a href=""http://hiring.monster.co.uk/hr/hr-best-practices/market-intelligence/labour-statistics-trends/job-jargon-infographic.aspx"">A poll conducted by Monster.com</a> revealed some disturbing facts regarding the way that job seekers perceive jargon.</p><div><ul><li>One-third of job seekers find industry jargon confusing.</li><li>60 percent find jargon annoying.</li><li>More than half are put off from applying for a job if the posting uses jargon.</li></ul></div><p>By causing confusion among potential applicants about what the role entails, jargon-using recruiters can inadvertently exclude capable people from the pool of candidates.</p><h3>Say what you mean</h3><p>One of the main problems with industry jargon is that you can fall into the trap of lazily reaching for stock terms and phrases without pausing to consider what they mean. Try to explain the role and its requirements using plain English. Using jargon can be a sign that employers are not sure what type of job seeker they want. Recruiters who find themselves falling into this trap should spend more time considering what their organization needs.</p><h3>Use jargon only when necessary</h3><p>There are circumstances where jargon is needed. For example, if a requirement of the job is that a candidate must possess a certain qualification or be familiar with a particular piece of software, then the relevant terms obviously need to be included. In these cases, using industry jargon weeds out candidates who do not have the relevant skills, qualifications or experience.</p><h3>What about acronyms and abbreviations?</h3><p>Job descriptions that are densely packed with industry terms are difficult to read; <a href=""http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobposter/small-business/article.aspx?articleid=ATL_0083BETTERJOBPOSTINGS"">overuse of abbreviations</a> can look unprofessional. If an acronym is widely used in the industry, you may be able to use it without causing confusion in your candidates, but in general, it is best to spell out what you want as clearly as possible.</p><p>When posting on online job sites, such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>, candidates find job postings by searching for relevant keywords, so include these search terms in full in your job title or description. For example, even though a candidate searching for a Registered Nurse position will understand the acronym RN, they might not find your job posting if you do not include the full job title.</p><h3>Avoid jargon, get results</h3><p>A successful job posting includes a clear description of the role and the requirements to apply for the job. Using plain English as much as possible can broaden the pool of applicants and avoid causing confusion. Banish unnecessary jargon from your job postings today and start communicating clearly with candidates.</p>"Career,Eliminate Unmotivated Candidates,"<h1>4 Ways to Quickly Eliminate Unmotivated Candidates<br></h1><p>Anyone who has posted a job opening within the last few years knows that you can almost always expect a flood of applications. When you add the fact that most HR departments are overextended, the need to quickly and efficiently sift through candidates becomes critical. With a bit of creativity, you can eliminate unmotivated candidates and spend more time on the job seekers who deserve it. Here are four ways to eliminate unmotivated candidates.<br></p><h3>1. Be clear about the requirements in the job description</h3><p>The best place to begin knocking out unmotivated candidates is right in the job description. State clearly what is expected, including the ability to go above and beyond to complete tasks. Unmotivated job seekers usually realize when they are getting in over their heads and will move on to the next job posting. It is better to overstate the workload of the job you need filled in order to attract capable, eager applicants. Having said that, make sure you don't set the bar too high. Automatic applicant screening software can eliminate candidates who would be ideal if you require every criteria to be met. According to the<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304821304577436172660988042.html"">Wall Street Journal</a>, hiring companies often try too hard to find the perfect candidate: ""Managers pile up so many requirements that they make it nearly impossible to find anyone who fits.""</p><h3>2. Warn applicants how long the process will take</h3><p>Another great way to stop unmotivated job seekers in their tracks is to give a warning at the beginning of the online application process stating how long it will take. Forty-five minutes will eliminate a percentage of lazy people. Some employers take it even further by requiring two or more hours to complete the initial online application. The reasoning here is that a truly motivated employee who knows they are a good fit for the position should be willing to devote serious time to this process. </p><h3>3. Weed out generic cover letters</h3><p>One of the best places to catch unmotivated candidates is the cover letter. A surprisingly large percentage of job seekers use the same cover letter for every application, substituting a few words here and there. A well-written cover letter should include a paragraph explaining why the candidate is the best choice for the position, covering specific details of the job and company. It should also highlight some of the ways that the candidate intends to solve problems for the company. The resume <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/03/10-ways-the-job-search-has-changed_n_3533836.html"">shouldfocus</a> on the employer's needs rather than the applicant's.<br></p><h3>4. Include custom questions in the application</h3><p>Many job seekers use the ""shotgun approach,"" which is applying to as many jobs as they can in the hopes of having something stick. These tend to be exactly the types of employees you want to eliminate, since they just want to land any job that they can. One way to catch them is to insert long-form question fields into the application. Motivated applicants will give these questions serious thought and provide well-written answers. This strategy will eliminate unmotivated candidates who are likely to do the bare minimum so that they can move on to their next application.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Resumes,When to Pop the Salary Question,"<div><h1>When to Pop the Salary Question</h1></div><div><p>One of the most potentially awkward aspects of interviewing job candidates is tackling the issue of salary. Candidates dread the negotiation process, but you can make it easier for both of you by following a few simple guidelines.</p></div><h3>When to talk about a salary</h3><div><p>The best time to negotiate a salary is at the end of the interview when you have a good idea of what the candidate can bring to the organization. You cannot responsibly manage a negotiation <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/11/jobs/how-to-play-your-hand-for-a-salary.html"">until you have formed an impression of what the candidate is worth</a>. Your first priority before talking about money should therefore be to assess the candidate's suitability for the role.</p></div><div><p>Candidates are also more likely to feel comfortable discussing salary at the end of the interview, once they have had the chance to find out more about the job's responsibilities. Before trying to pin down a figure, make sure you let the candidate know about the benefits they can enjoy while working for your company. These perks might include opportunities for training and career progression, as well as other employee benefits, such as childcare, healthcare, bonuses, stock options or employer-supported pension plans. Candidates are often willing to accept a slightly lower salary if they know that the company will treat them well.</p><h3>When to bring up salary early</h3></div><div>The exception to the rule of waiting to discuss salary is when you have a <a href=""http://partners.nytimes.com/library/jobmarket/072797sabra.html"">strict hiring budget</a> and need to check that a candidate's minimum salary requirement falls within the affordable range. In this case, it makes sense to ask the candidate to declare the minimum salary that they will accept before you spend time assessing their suitability for the job. Bringing up salary early in the interview allows both parties to find out early if their salary expectations are incompatible.</div><h3>How to negotiate a salary</h3><div><p>Talking about compensation with a prospective employee is a necessary part of the hiring process. Here are some tips for broaching the subject:</p></div><div><ul><li>You can begin to bring up the subject of employee compensation by discussing the candidate's salary history. You can do this while going over the work history presented on the resume with the candidate. This creates a reference figure that you can use to anchor the salary negotiation.<br></li></ul><div><ul><li>Try not to suggest an exact figure right away. Instead, ask the candidate about their salary expectations. Going through the <a href=""http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/04/14/when-should-you-discuss-your-salary-in-a-job-interview/"">process of negotiation</a> is an opportunity for interviewers to assess the negotiation skills of candidates and find out how they value their own skills.<br></li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Ask the candidate to justify their expected salary, especially if they are looking for a raise compared to their previous position. Are they going to be taking on a position of greater responsibility in your organization?</li></ul><ul><li>Ask the candidate to consider how other priorities, such as employee benefits and opportunities for career progression, stack up for them compared to salary.<br></li></ul></div></div><h3>Leading successful salary negotiations</h3><div><p>Many people find discussing money to be rather awkward, but a discussion about salary is unavoidable when hiring a new employee. Approach the subject professionally and with confidence by following the advice provided above.</p></div>"Interviews,Men: Interview Dress Tips That Never Go out of Style,"<p></p><h2>Men: Interview Dress Tips That Never Go out of Style</h2><p>The biggest problem with interview attire today is the rise of casual workplace settings and the numbers of candidates who dress to match them. Interviews are still a place where showing respect is key. Suits are preferred by most companies, even those where the CEO wears T-shirts and jeans. In order to avoid getting caught in these and other interview faux pas, pay attention to the following tips before you get dressed for your next job interview.</p><p></p><h3>Shirt, tie and shoes to match</h3><p></p><p>Some men show up to entry-level interviews dressed to the nines. They go overboard, knowing they'll never be asked to wear a tie or three-piece suit if they land the position. Then they screw it all up by putting on a pair of ragged sneakers or scuffed up shoes. </p><p></p><p>The details count. Leave your hipster pants at home and give yourself a chance at getting hired before letting the company know ""who you really are."" This isn't a speed date;it's a job interview. There will be plenty of time to let your personality shine once you're hired.</p><p></p><p>Sticking to the time-honored traditions of landing a job, show up to an interview looking like you're applying to run the place. The adage ""dress for success"" is taken seriously by hiring managers who make decisions based on certain appearance-related assumptions. <a href=""http://mashable.com/2013/02/10/job-interview-attire/"">Namely, experts say, someone poorly dressed at an interview doesn't have the business sense to do well on the job.</a></p><p></p><p>Select clothing for one step above what you would expect to wear to work every day, making the minimal choice business causal. For men who aren't fashion-conscious enough to know the difference, that means khakis and dress shirts. Even then, bring along a blazer just in case.</p><p></p><p>If you'll be working in an office, aim for a suit and tie. Executive positions mean pulling out all the stops. No tails are required, but you'll want to show up looking as tailored as possible. </p><p></p><h3>Scents and accessories</h3><p></p><p>It's easy for the small details to intimidate you when preparing for an interview. Many men don't understand what accessories to wear or leave at home, and they aren't sure what the rules are on cologne. Are you expected to wear it? Should you avoid it? On your big day, there are four things every man should be, according to professional career counselor<a href=""http://mashable.com/2013/02/10/job-interview-attire/"">Gaye Weintraub</a>: </p><p></p><ul><li>Well-groomed</li><li>Well-dressed</li><li>Smelling nice</li><li>Smiling</li></ul><p></p><p>That doesn't mean you drench yourself in scent. To smell nice, bathe using soap, brush your teeth and apply antiperspirant or deodorant. Take a refresher kit with you in case you start to sweat or wind up having something to eat or drink. It's best to leave fragrances for your first day of work.</p><p></p><p>Make sure you are well-groomed so that your appearance looks tidy. That means shaving. Shaving makes you look more serious. It can also make you appear youngereven trimmed beards can give the wrong impression. <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1100369"">As one pro put it, ""Too lazy to shave = too lazy to work.""</a></p><p></p><p>Along with being dressed in business or business casual attire, make your accessories match your look. For men, this usually limits you to a simple, stylish watch, clean business dress shoes or loafers and a wedding ring, if you have one. Surprisingly, scuffed shoes are one of the leading faux pas men make with their wardrobe. Don't make that mistake.

To nail an interview, you have to cover the basics. You've probably heard most of these before, but it never hurts to review. Soak in these tips to make an impression during your next job interview.</p><h3><b>Time is of the Essence</b></h3><p>Be on time, be on time and be on time again. If you show up even a minute or two late, it will reflect negatively on you, either in the sense that you are not that reliable or didn't see the interview as important. You should plan on being there at least 10 minutes early, so preparing ahead of time will help you make sure this happens. Know exactly where you are going and how long it will take to get there. </p><h3><b>Dress for Success</b></h3><p>You have total control over this step, and you should use that fact to your advantage. Dressing appropriately for the job for which you are interviewing is critical. If you show up extremely under-dressed for the position, they may not take you seriously as a candidate and might think you are not taking the interview seriously.</p><div><h3><b>Be Prepared</b></h3><p>Print out your resume and any other paperwork that you might need for your interview the night before. This will keep you from rushing around at the last minute trying to figure out what you need. Also, you should have an idea of what you want to ask or say to your interviewer. Showing that you have an interest and are knowledgeable about the organization will go a long way. Research the company thoroughly beforehand.</p><h3><b>Use Proper Speech</b></h3><p>Interviewers are trained to feel you out, and they expect you to use proper speech. Lose any slang you normally utilize and only carry your professional language skills in with you. Likewise, try to minimize or eliminate any filler words such as uh and um. It is okay to be nervous, but try your best to impress the interviewer with your communication skills, since they are important for most jobs.</p><h3><b>It Isn't Over 'Til it's Over</b></h3><p>Just because you've stood up from the desk and shook the interviewer's hand doesn't mean the interview process is over. You should keep your cellphone in your pocket until you make it to your car. You will most likely want to share the news about how your interview went, but the right time and place to do that is not on the premises. You never know who will be walking down the hall, riding in the elevator or even sitting outside on break, overhearing everything you have to say. Don't say anything that will ruin all the hard work that went into your job interview.</p></div>"Resumes,Never Use the Same Resume Twice,"<h1>Never Use the Same Resume Twice</h1><p>If you upload or mail the same resume every time you apply to a new position, youre missing out on an opportunity to stand out and get noticed.

Finding a job and networking suddenly become imperative. If you're a college student or a new college grad who is still choosing a career, we'd like to turn yourattention to opportunities in these high-growth markets. Based on research completed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, here are five of the fastest-growing careers available to new graduates.<br></p><h3>5. Nursing</h3><p>Nursing tends to find a spot on ""top jobs"" lists every year. The reason? Its an in-demand position that requires extensive training and dedication. Many people lack the fortitude to complete nursing school and go on to help patients in real-world situations. It takes a special type of person to study and succeed in this field, so the supply of workers is narrow.</p><p>National demographics have heightened the need. There are an increasing number of people who need medical care. Baby boomers are reaching the age where they require medical care in order to remain active and healthy. As doctors and hospitals become busier with the needs of baby boomers, and boomers retire and slow down, the demand for qualified nurses grows.</p><h3>4. Financial Adviser</h3><p>Markets continue to decline and businesses are increasingly regulated, so companies and individuals are turning to financial advisers to help plan and control their financial investments and budgets. Some financial advisers specialize in corporate finances while others offer personal services. Regardless of the emphasis, financial advisers are becoming more common in the realms of corporate and personal finance.<br></p><h3>3. Public Relations</h3><p>PR is one of the fastest growing industries in the market today. Why?Social media.Social media has become powerful as companies are able to communicate with customers directly. As a result, PR is more important than ever. PR disasters are all-too-common on social media, and companies need proswhocan represent their brand and put out fires before they spread. As the number of social media channels and their importance increases, so will demand for people who understand social media and have PR skills.<br></p><h3>2. Marketing Consultant</h3><p>As with public relations, social media and the Internet have changed the game for marketers. There is a growing demand for marketing pros who understand how to thrive in cyberspace. This is because many traditional marketing tactics do not work online. As customers go mobile with their attention, companies must adapt or risk losing business.</p><p>Because this industry is new and potentially lucrative, competition is fierce. Small, adaptive marketing firms often compete better than their well-established, larger, off-line counterparts. These small companies are becoming the go-to marketing firms for many of the worlds leading businesses, and as they grow so do their personnel needs.</p><h3>1. Accountant</h3><p>Most of the jobs on this list are related to business and finance. As markets change and economic uncertainty persists, businesses and individuals are turning to specialists to manage their money. Because of this, and because of increasingly complicated tax and healthcare laws, accountants are almost always at the top of these lists. No shock theyre No. 1 again.</p><p>Based on current job trends, the safe bet for new college grads is to aim for careers in healthcare and business solutions. Some of these fields require additional training, but each potentially provides a stable and financially rewarding career for those who pursue them.</p>"Interviews,10 Interview Tips for New Graduates,"<p></p><div><div><h1>10 Interview Tips for New Graduates</h1></div></div><p>If you're like most new graduates, you're looking to start your career soon. These interview tips for new graduates should increase your confidence and improve your chances of getting the position you want. Good luck!<br></p> <p><b>1. Research the company.</b> You might have thought your days of doing homework were over, but they're not. Your most important assignment is to research the company. Make sure you understand its history, mission and structure, as well as what your job would entail. <br></p> <p><b>2. Make a good first impression. </b>Dress conservatively, keeping makeup, jewelry and perfume to a minimum. Shave or groom facial hair, and keep any tattoos or piercings hidden. You should also make sure you arrive a few minutes early so you are not rushing into the lobby looking anxious and disheveled. <br></p> <p><b>3. Draw on your experience as a college student. </b>You might not have much experience with a career yet, but you have likely learned a lot in classes, clubs, internships and part-time jobs. Keep in mind the lessons you have taken from college and use them when answering questions during interviews. <br></p> <p><b>4. Come prepared with documents.</b> Even though the interviewer already has your resume on file, that doesn't mean he or she will have it printed out and ready to look at. Show that you are extra prepared by bringing a file folder or small briefcase that contains a copy of your resume, writing samples (if relevant) and a notepad and pen so you can take notes. <br></p> <p><b>5. Prepare answers to common questions. </b>Interviews are much easier when you already know the answers. Make sure you know your greatest strengths and weaknesses, for example. If you don't have any previous professional experience, base your answer on the skills you can bring to this position.<br></p> <p><b>6. Record your practice responses. </b>According to this good advice from<a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2013/05/14/5-quick-interview-tips-for-new-grads"">U.S. News & World Report</a>, you can work on reducing filler words and sounds when you see and hear yourself answer questions. Once you know how you come across during interviews, you can sound more professional. <br></p> <p><b>7. Be prepared to explain weaknesses in your job application.</b> If you were fired from your last job or have gaps in your resume, the interviewer will want to address these possible issues. Keep them from becoming deal-breakers by explaining why they occurred and what you have learned from them that will help you in your next position. <br></p> <p><b>8. Focus on ways you can improve the company. </b>If you have any examples of ways you added value to the places you worked or volunteered at in school, bring them up when appropriate. For example, if you increased profits, reduced expenses in some way or even simply solved an important problem for your boss, let the interviewer know about it.<br></p> <p><b>9. Ask questions.</b> Most interviewers make it a point to find out if job applicants have any questions for them, so make sure you have some prepared. According to <a href=""http://andychan.opcd.wfu.edu/2013/06/top-10-interview-tips-for-new-college-graduates/"">Andy Chan, Wake Forest University's Vice President for Personal and Career Development</a>, this is a good way to show that you did your homework on the company. Just don't ask questions that are clearly answered on the company website.<br></p> <p><b>10. Show your enthusiasm for the job.</b> You can do this by sending an email or even a card in the mail to show your appreciation for the chance to interview for the position. This is one of those interview tips most new graduates have probably heard before, but that's because it is important to finish strong, no matter where you are in your career.</p>"Interviews,How to Prepare for a Job Interview,"<h1>How to Prepare for a Job Interview</h1> <p>Congrats! You landed the interview. Now you just need to impress them enough to make it to the second round. In addition to cleaning yourself up and making a copy of your resume (which you already know you should do!), determined applicants must go a little farther to impress a hiring manager. Your goal is for the manager to remember you over all of the other candidates for the job. To do that, you'll need to be thorough and think creatively.</p> <h3>Go beyond the basics when researching the company</h3> <p>To prepare for the job interview, research the company thoroughly. Look at everything from the company's website to its Wiki page. Then, go deeper. Check its Twitter and Facebook statuses. Read the company's latest press releases and articles that mention it by name. You can use this intel to show interest in the organization, and that will go a long way in impressing the hiring manager. As the <a href=""http://www.va.gov/jobs/hiring/interview.asp"">US Department of Veterans Affairs</a> suggests, you can also talk to other people within the organization beforehand to find out what's happening.</p><h3>Clear those pages</h3><p> </p><p>Employers will check your social media pages to find out as much as they can about you even long before you step foot in the door for the interview. Get rid of those pictures on your account of your partying Saturday nights. Ensure you are not talking bad about the company in your status posts, either. As reported by the<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/20/employers-use-facebook-to-pre-screen-applicants_n_1441289.html"">Huffington Post</a>, as many as 32 percent of employers use social media websites to research applicants.</p> <h3>Get revved up</h3> <p>Often times, it takes an interviewee about five or more minutes to really warm up and let his or her guard down during an interview. To make a difference to the hiring manager, be ready to go before you get in the office. Review your resume a few minutes prior to walking in the door. Be ready with a 60-second ""commercial"" about yourself to answer the ""tell me about yourself"" question. Reviewing beforehand allows you to be ready to go at 100 percent as soon as you sit down.</p><p>An easy tip from <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/here-there-and-everywhere/201206/10-ways-ace-job-interview"">PsychologyToday.com's</a> Stephanie Sarkis, PhD, is to simply act like you are confident even if you are not. In other words, fake it. Keep telling yourself, in your mind, that you are confident. Soon enough, you will be.</p> <h3>Don't forget the basics</h3> <p>Even with these tips, you still need to do the basics of preparing for a job interview. Remember the following:</p><p></p><ul><li>Dress professionally and with distinction.<br></li><li>Arrive at least 10 minutes early.<br></li><li>Be organized and neat with a notepad, your resume on quality paper and a list of your references.<br></li><li>Always be honest. Hiring managers receive training on how to spot signs of deception or misleading information.<br></li><li>Always be positive. You want to leave the interview on a positive note, talking about good things.<br></li><li>Downplay the reason that you are leaving your current employer and never bad mouth anyone.<br></li></ul><p></p><p></p> By taking the time to prepare for the job interview, not only will you do a better job once you arrive, but you will also feel more confident in your abilities. Being confident, concise and clear can make a big difference in any hiring manager's willingness to interview you again."Career,Feeling Lost? Take an Aptitude Test,"<h1><b>Feeling Lost? Take an Aptitude Test</b></h1> <p>Aptitude tests are an underused resource for job seekers and those seeking a career change. In fact, you could argue that a great deal of unhappiness in the workplace might be prevented if job seekers started out by deciding what they wanted to do and persistently pursued that goal instead of feeling pressured to take whatever job was available at the moment.</p><p>A Gallup poll revealed that <a href=""http://businessjournal.gallup.com/content/162953/tackle-employees-stagnating-engagement.aspx"">70 percent of employees</a> are either ""not engaged"" or ""actively disengaged"" with their work. That's more than two out of three people you have ever worked with. The costs are staggering, both for economic development on a national level and in terms of stress-related illnesses on a personal level.</p><p>But because of high unemployment numbers, people are staying longer in jobs they don't like.

That's why we're spotlighting these 10 growing occupations. Take a look at this list.You might notice a pattern. Many of them are in the technology and healthcare industries. That might not be a bad place for you to be, too.<br></p> <p><b>1. Biomedical Engineer:</b> According to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/education/edlife/edl-17conted-t.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"">The New York Times</a>, this is a fairly new career that is poised to grow by about 72 percent by 2018. Biomedical engineers do everything from crafting devices to improving processes in the medical community.<br></p> <p><b>2. Home Health Aide: </b>If you like the idea of caring for patients in their home, this career should appeal to you. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45fmhd/3-home-health-aides/"">Forbes</a> has reported that the demand for home health aides will rise by about 69 percent by 2020. For many people, this career is a way into the healthcare industry, since it involves light medical duties. One look at the large population of senior citizens should make it clear why this occupation is growing. <br></p> <p><b>3. Personal Care Aide:</b> The <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_103.htm"">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> estimates that this career will grow by about 70 percent. The duties are similar to those of a home health aide, but there are no medical tasks involved. The emphasis is on housekeeping, meal preparation and personal hygiene help for people who are ill or elderly. <br></p> <p><b>4. Telecommunications Network Engineer: </b><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/pf/jobs/1010/gallery.best_jobs_job_growth.moneymag/2.html"">CNN Money</a> claims this occupation should grow by about 53 percent in the next decade. If you want a career in technology, particularly managing networks, you should look into this promising option.<br></p> <p><b>5. Physical Therapist:</b> <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/pf/jobs/1010/gallery.best_jobs_job_growth.moneymag/6.html"">CNN Money</a> reports that this career will grow by about 30 percent, probably because preventive care is more important than ever. There is also a newfound focus on general wellness and strength in society.<br></p> <p><b>6. Employment Recruiter:</b> According to <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/pf/jobs/1010/gallery.best_jobs_job_growth.moneymag/7.html"">CNN Money</a>, as the economy continues to improve, businesses will hire again. They'll need help from recruiters who can find great new hires for them. The job growth estimate for this career is 28 percent. <br></p> <p><b>7. Registered Nurse: </b>This follows the trend of the growing healthcare industry. You will likely find that this position is more challenging than the job of a personal or home health aide, and it also requires an associate's degree in nursing. However, the pay tends to be higher to compensate for these additional demands. According to <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45fmhd/1-registered-nurses/"">Forbes</a>, this occupation should grow by about 26 percent by 2020.<br></p> <p><b>8. Physician Assistant: </b>This occupation should grow by about 39 percent in the next 10 years, according to <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/pf/jobs/1010/gallery.best_jobs_job_growth.moneymag/3.html"">CNN Money</a>. Like the other healthcare-related jobs, this one is rising in demand because of the aging population. Physician assistants can diagnose and treat patients not unlike doctors, which is another reason for the growing popularity. <br></p> <p><b>9. Software Architect:</b> If you enjoy creating new software programs, this job may interest you. According to <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/pf/jobs/1010/gallery.best_jobs_job_growth.moneymag/4.html"">CNN Money</a>, its rate of growth is about 34 percent.  <br></p> <p><b>10.

It involves both preventing and treating athletic injuries.</p>"Job Search Tips,What to Do Once You Receive a Job Offer,"<p></p><h1>What to Do Once You Receive a Job Offer</h1><p>It can be tempting to jump and down and accept a job offer the second you get it, but this is not always the wisest choice, and you could end up regretting your quick decision later. Before you make a final decision on whether to accept the job you have been offered, take note of these tips. <br></p> <h3>Get the Offer in Writing <br></h3> <p>If you get a phone call with the news, ask if you can get the offer in writing, even if it is just a short email. According to <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2010/07/19/5-things-to-do-when-you-get-a-job-offer"">U.S. News & World Report</a>, this can give you some recourse if you later find that the offer is not as good as you originally thought. For example, you might find that the salary and benefits are lower than you were told or that your job duties will be different from what you thought. Even if all the details are not yet worked out, you should at least ask for a written copy of the job description, title and estimated salary. <br></p> <h3>Request Time to Think It Over <br></h3> <p>Most employers should realize you need some time to make your decision, so be wary if the company demands an answer the same day. If a deadline for your decision is not given, you should ask by what date you have to have an answer. After all, you will need some time to not only think about your options, but also compare the offer with any others you have received. This could take anywhere from a few days to a week on average, which is why most companies offer a week to get a decision. <br></p> <h3>Ask Any Questions You Have <br></h3> <p>Surely you have some lingering questions about the company and position that you never got a chance to ask during the interview process. Now is the time to ask those questions. <a href=""http://work.chron.com/after-job-offer-11414.html"">The Houston Chronicle</a> suggests you start by finding out to whom you will be reporting, then attempt to get more in-depth answers to any questions that were only briefly addressed during interviews. You need to make sure you have all the facts down before you make a decision. <br></p> <h3>Do Your Own Research <br></h3> <p>There are some questions you might not get a clear answer to when you talk to the hiring manager. You can use your research skills to find out what you need to know. For example, you can check online reviews that were written by past and current employees to get a feel for the good and bad that comes with the company. If you know anyone who works for the company or has in the past, consider asking what they like and dislike about it. <br></p> <h3>Negotiate</h3> <p>The final step in the process is perhaps the most important one, since it involves your salary and benefits. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2012/10/17/the-questions-you-must-ask-yourself-before-accepting-a-job-offer/"">Forbes</a> recommends that you first find out if the salary you have been offered is negotiable. Then think about whether it is competitive for your field and what you believe you deserve for the work you will be doing. <br></p> <p>Be sure to also ask about the benefits, including health insurance, paid time off, 401(k) matching, tuition reimbursement and any other perks you have been promised, then find out when you are eligible for them. If the answers sound acceptable to you at least after a little negotiating you should feel ready to formally accept the job offer!</p>"Resumes,How Much Education Should I Include on My Resume?,"<h1><b>How Much Education Should I Include on My Resume?</b></h1><p>There was a time when the education section of your resume was a no-brainer. If you had a bachelor's degree, you listed it. If you had a master's degree, you listed it. If you had a doctorate, why were you filling out job applications? Today's resume is a far more complex matter.</p><p>Community colleges, private employee learning centers, adult education classes at major universities, online courses and international degrees add up to a confusing tangle of para-education for employers to sort through. You don't want to be eliminated on a technicality, such as ""too much education,"" so it is important to pay close attention to this area. We've put together the latest advice from <a href=""http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jlarsen/rex2/education.html"">career advisers at universities</a> and <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/06/20/10-things-to-leave-off-your-resume"">hiring managers</a> at <a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/Why-I-Tossed-Your-R-sum-/131576/"">major corporations</a> to help you customize and perfect the education section of your resume for each prospective employer.</p> <h3>Lead with Experience</h3> <p>Your education section should follow the professional experience section unless you don't have any relevant experience for the specific position you want. As you can see, you will need more than one customized resume, and some job seekers modify each resume to highlight different areas of their background.</p> <h3>What the Education Section Should Include</h3> <p>List the most recent education first, then proceed in reverse chronological order. You can choose the order that best fits your format, but the descriptions should include the full name of the university (no abbreviations or initials), type of the degree, field of study and date of graduation. If you are still enrolled, list an expected graduation date. Finally, you must include the city and state. GPA is not necessary or customary unless it is remarkable or expected in your field.</p> <h3> <p>What it Normally Does Not Include</p></h3> <p>Continuing education and professional coursework normally should not be included here but can be addressed in the cover letter. However, three exceptions to this rule are those cases where 1) your education is light; 2) the qualifications mention a degree you don't have; 3) your degrees do not address the demands of the new position. For example, if your degree was in English and the job is in management, any statistics, coaching or accounting coursework would be very important for the hiring manager.</p> <p>Community college has become a feeder for larger universities with strict admissions guidelines. Employers are well aware of that, so it is not necessary to list the community college where you spent the first two years of your degree. However, it is sometimes to your benefit to do so. Community colleges afford better professor/student ratios that make it easier to get great references with connections in the industry where you want to work. If your reference will be from your community college, include it, and make it one of your strengths in the cover letter.</p><h3><b>The Very Large Business Card</b></h3><p>Consider your resume to be an extended business card. It is merely a placeholder designed to let the hiring team know in general terms how close your experience fits the needs of the job. This is not a place to attempt to impress anyone with your education. The cover letter and your interview will provide plenty of time and space to discuss your proudest moments. Resumes are mainly used now to weed out candidates, so the more succinct and relevant you are, the better your chances of making it through to the next round.</p>"Resumes,How to Write a Proper Nursing Resume,"<div><h1>How to Write a Proper Nursing Resume</h1></div>In today's technological world, applicant tracking remains an integral part of medical hiring. The hierarchical rankings in such systems necessitate thorough resumes from aspiring employees, as an incomplete submission could lead to a low position, and with it, no job. Include the following experiences on your resume and you'll be sure to snag more interviews and, ultimately, a good nursing job.<h3><b>Volunteer and Charity Experience</b></h3><div>There are few qualities health care employers like to see more than genuine passion for helping those less fortunate. One of the best ways to prove this type of dedication is to highlight occasions in which your nursing abilities were harnessed for the greater good with no expectation of recompense. Whether your unique experience involved emergency care on a disaster scene or a stint with Nurses Across Borders, this addition to your resume will show recruiters that you're passionate about health care and willing to go the extra mile.</div><h3><b>Tech Experience</b></h3><div>Today anyone and everyone possessing tech experience holds great value in the medical world. In the interest of efficiency and accuracy, a wide array of hospitals and practices have implemented everything from electronic medical records to mobile health screenings. Nurses adept at deciphering new technological developments are in great demand, as recruiters understand the implications of a resume complete with tech experience. Specific examples showing your technology know-how could include computer science classes you took in college or a medical billing program you used in a previous position.</div><div><h3><b>Nursing Affiliations</b></h3><div>Between research breakthroughs and new technological developments, the medical field is always changing. Employers hate to see nurses whose skills and knowledge go stagnant. The best way to show your dedication to improvement is to include your nursing affiliations on your resume. If you are not yet a member of any professional nursing associations, now is the time to sign up. Consider looking into the American Nurses Association, the American Academy of Nursing and the International Council of Nurses.</div></div><h3><b>Licensing Specifics</b></h3><div>If you want your resume to be immediately removed from contention, all you need to is neglect to include specific licensing information. Employers want to know the current level at which you are licensed through the <a href=""https://www.ncsbn.org/247.htm"">National Council of State Boards of Nursing</a>. The licensure section of your resume should include specifics related to the type of licensure obtained (for example, RN vs LPN), as well as the date received and any recent updates. Be able to back up this accreditation with an official certificate.</div><div><br></div><div>A thorough yet concise nursing resume is the first step on your journey to gainful employment. By including relevant information related to your education and career background, you can convince prospective employers of your reliability, thus setting yourself ahead of the competition. Once you've distinguished yourself as the cream of the crop with a killer resume, you can confidently enter the job search process. There are plenty of prospective employers--all eager to see your resume and accompanying cover letter--on<a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>.</div>"Resumes,Resume Outline: The Basics,"<h1><b>Resume Outline: The Basics</b></h1> <p></p> <p>Whether you have been employed for years or are just starting out in the workforce, writing a resume can be a difficult task. You have limited space to list your accomplishments and show an employer what makes you right for the job. However, with the right structure, youll be able to create a resume that will catch the eye of a hiring manager and help you land an interview. The best place to start is by creating a resume outline.The basics of a resume are simple. Here's what needs to be included:</p><h3>Contact Information</h3><p>The placement of your contact information is very important, particularly since many firms use screening software to rank resumes. Your name should be the firstitem you place on your resume. Next, you will need to enter your physical address as well as your phone number. It's also a good idea to include your email address, but make sure it is a professional sounding email address. For example, you don't want the email address you created as a teenager going on your resume. If you have a website, you can also add it, but this is optional. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Objective or Summary of Qualifications</b></h3> <p></p> <p>This section is designed to state the type of job in which you are interested. For example, if you are interested in seeking a management position in marketing, this is where you would put that information. You also can use this section to <a href=""http://www.uwb.edu/careers/job-search-tools/resumes/functional-outline"">summarize the qualifications</a> that make you an attractive candidate for the position. Always customize this section for the specific job for which you are applying.</p> <p></p> <h3><b>Skills</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>This section should be used to go into a little detail about your skills. Dont list everyday skills. Focus on specific skill sets that match what the position calls for. A bullet list or even a graphic is an attractive way to highlight your skills. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Education</b></h3> <p></p> <p>If you do not have a college degree, this can be a tricky area. If relevant, include certifications or continuing education courses that you have attended. Otherwise, list the college or university you attended, the dates you were there and your major. If your GPA was over 3.5 and you are still a student or are entering the workforce, you can also include that information. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Experience</b></h3> <p></p> <p>The experience section is a history of your past employment. Most hiring managers prefer to see this in <a href=""http://www.washington.edu/admin/hr/roles/ee/careerdev/jobsearch-tools/resumebasics.html"">reverse chronological order</a>, with your most recent employer first. Include your job title, the name of the company, the dates you worked and a brief description of your duties in that position. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Other Things to Include</b></h3> <p></p> <p>If you have space left on your resume, it is a good idea to go into brief detail on any extra experience you may have. For example, including volunteer work you have done will help show another side of your personality. You can also include any affiliations you have with professional organizations or current classes you are taking that enhance your skill sets. Put yourself in the mindset of a hiring manager and include information they would like to see. </p><p>This resume outline will help you structure your next resume. It is also helpful to download a resume template for your word processing program that will have these sections delineated. Focus on what makes you the ideal candidate for the position and tailor each resume to suit the position in which you are interested.</p>"Job Search Tips,Military Resume: Transitioning to the Private Sector,"<h1>Use Your Military Resume to Your Advantage in Your Job Search</h1> <p></p> <p></p> <p>So youve just finished your military service. Youve arrived home to fanfare from your friends and family, along with dinners, drinks, celebrations and nights out. As the dust settles, you start thinking about the next stage of your life and wonder how youll acclimate to the civilian world. Fortunately, your service is an enormous asset in the job market, and there are numerous ways you can use your military resume to your advantage. The following are a few ideas to get you started on your post-military job search.</p> <h3><b>Resources Available to Veterans on the Internet</b></h3> <p>The United States is a nation that honors its veterans. Regardless of ones political views, the sacrifice and courage of our armed servicemen and servicewomen is recognized. This goes beyond VA benefits; there are a number of online resources that veterans can use to get a start on their private sector careers.</p> <p></p><ul><li>CareerOneStop:<a href=""http://www.dod.jobsearch.org/"">http://www.dod.jobsearch.org/</a><br></li><li>TAOnline:<a href=""http://www.TAOnline.com"">www.TAOnline.com</a><br></li><li>MilitaryHire:<a href=""http://www.militaryhire.com/"">http://www.militaryhire.com/</a><br></li><li>VetJobs:<a href=""http://www.vetjobs.com/"">http://www.vetjobs.com/</a><br></li></ul><div>In addition to resources specifically designed for veterans, check out employment resources available to the general public.

Add your military experience to your Simply Hired Resume and Cover Letters. This is a significant distinguishing factor between you and other job seekers that can make you stand out.</div><p></p> <h3><b>Law Enforcement or Defense Contracting</b></h3> <p>Law enforcement is a viable career option for veterans. The regimented structure is familiar, and many of the requirements for being an effective law enforcement officer are essential to being an effective member of the armed services. </p> <p>Defense contracting is a way to utilize first-hand experience with military equipment in the private sector. A veterans experience in knowing how weapons, systems and equipment are actually used and the types of real-world problems that arise in the field provide valuable insight to defense contractors who are designing and manufacturing equipment being used in the military.</p> <p>Even if you choose to go a different route outside of law enforcement or defense contractor, think of ways you can translate your military skills and experience into skills an employer would want from their employees. Discipline, work ethic and the ability to focus and be productive under pressure are skills every veteran has that some employers love.</p> <h3><b>GI Bill</b></h3> <p><a href=""http://www.gibill.va.gov/"">As the Department of Veterans Affairs website</a>states, the GI Bill is an incredibly valuable resource for veterans who want to get their bachelors or masters degree after completing their service. Going back to school is a great way to build upon the skills and experiences you had while in the military. It is well-documented that veterans with a bachelors or masters degree have a distinct advantage in the job market. </p> <h3><b>Skill Certifications from the Department of Defense</b></h3> <p>According to the <a href=""http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=116587"">Defense Department</a>, the federal government has expanded its program for certifying and credentialing veterans for the various skills they developed while serving. This puts veterans on even footing with those in the private sector who receive certifications from technical schools and universities. Having your certifications gives you an additional layer of credibility with employers who are looking at your resume.</p> <p>These are just a few of the ways you can use your military resume to your advantage in the private sector. Use the things that make you different as a starting point and as an advantage as you begin the next phase of your life.</p>"Interviews,Practice for Your Job Interview,"<h1><b>Practice for Your Job Interview</b></h1> <p></p> <p>The saying that ""practice makes perfect"" definitely applies to preparing for a job interview. We all know how stressful the interview process can be, but practicing ahead of time can give you confidence and make the interview experience a smooth one. The more you work on your interviewing skills, the more likely you are to appear ready in the eyes of a hiring manager, and that confidence could be the edge that gets you the job.</p> <p></p> <p>There are several ways you can practice for an upcoming interview. Lets take a look at a few of the best techniques. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Go Through Common Interview Questions</b></h3> <p></p> <p>One of the best ways to prepare for a job interview is to review a list of <a href=""http://www.western.edu/academics/career-services/interview-preparation.html"">common interview questions</a> and come up with good answers. Get a few sheets of paper and actually write down your responses. This will help you commit what you are saying to memory and will give you a chance to really think about how you want to answer those questions. </p> <p></p> <p>Reviewing questions ahead of time will minimize the chances you will be caught off-guard by a question. While each interviewer is going to have a different style and might ask different questions, running through sample questions will put you in the rhythm of selling yourself correctly.</p> <p></p> <p>Its also a not a bad idea to come up with a few questions of your own. Do a little background research on the company and put your list together. Interviewers typically ask if you have any questions, and it is a good idea to be prepared with a few of them when this question comes up. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Try a Mock Interview</b></h3> <p></p> <p>Ask a friend to sit down with you and conduct a mock interview. This is a good way to practice and build your confidence. Print out a list of commonly asked interview questions, and ask your friend to ask each one. Set the stage properly for this mock interview. If you have a home office with a desk, you can set up a similar environment to the one youll be in during the interview. Dress for the part as well. This exercise is great for calming nerves. Once you walk into the real interview, you will feel a lot more comfortable since you have already gone through something similar. Mock interviews are a way to train your brain to get over nerves. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>An Exercise to Try</b></h3> <p></p> <p>Another way to improve your confidence and prepare for the interview is to take a sheet of paper and<a href=""http://www.careeronestop.org/ResumesInterviews/Interviews/GetReady.aspx"">write down all of the skills</a> that are mentioned in the job listings description on one side. On the other side of the paper write down all of the skills you have that match that position. This shows you whether or not you are a qualified candidate, and it can also help you sell yourself during the interview. Use this trick to tailor your experience for each employerbefore you send in your resume.</p> <p></p> <p>Before your next job interview, give a few of these practice techniques a try. You might be surprised at how prepared you will feel, and you may notice that your nerves have been replaced by feelings of confidence.</p>"Resumes,Resume Tips: Avoid the Passive Voice,"<h1><b>Resume Tips: Avoid the Passive Voice</b></h1> <p>The problem with passive voice is the same problem that makes bureaucracies so inefficient and customer service so frustrating the glaring absence of someone to take responsibility. Many people resort to writing this way because they believe it sounds formal and professional. George Orwell astutely <a href=""https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm"">lampooned this style of writing</a> in his still fresh essay, <i>Politics and the English Language</i>, advocating:</p><p>""Decide what impressions one's words are likely to make on another person. This last effort of the mind cuts out all stale or mixed images, all prefabricated phrases, needless repetitions, and humbug and vagueness generally.""</p><p>Orwell's 4th rule for writing effectively is clear on this point: ""Never use the passivewhere you can use the active."" Job seekers often resort to passive voice in order to avoid overuse of sentences that begin with ""I"" because that is another resume tip candidates will often hear. While there are times when passive voice can be valuable, it is good to know how the passive voice sounds in context and why it is in your best interest to avoid the passive voice in resumes and cover letters.</p> <h3>Turning Passive into Active </h3> <p>Passive voice means that the writer has moved the direct object or predicate nominative to the front of the sentence. As a result, the verb becomes compounded and the subject of the sentence is moved to an adverbial phrase in the end or is completely erased. ""I did it,"" is active. ""It was done by me,"" is passive. Let's take a look at a few common passive constructions and how active voice improves them.</p> <p><b>Passive:</b> 20 percent revenue growth was realized in our department over two years.</p> <p><b>Active:</b> My team realized 20 percent revenue growth over two years.</p> <p><b>Passive:</b> A promotion to Supervisor was awarded to me after only one year of service.</p> <p><b>Active:</b> After only one year, I earned a promotion to Supervisor.</p> <p><b>Passive:</b> Responsibility was recognized as one of my strengths.</p> <p><b>Active:</b> I am responsible.</p> <p>Passive voice eliminates or downplays the agency of the action. In your resume and cover letter, you don't want to come across as a spectator to your own career. Make sure you are inclusive about who helped you with phrases like ""my team,"" or ""our department"" but be sure to take credit for your best qualities and what you have accomplished.</p> <h3>When Passive is Good</h3> <p>The time when passive voice may be appropriate is when you want to draw attention to the result instead of you. Perhaps you want to make a point but your contribution to the accomplishment was not clear, as in:</p> <p>""All departmental sales goals were exceeded during my tenure there.""</p> <p>Another good reason to use passive voice is when the subject of the sentence is so complex that an active construction would lessen the impact. For example:</p> <p>""Over $50 million in audited savings were recognized by the accounting department in the first year alone due to a variety of employee suggestions that I implemented.""</p><p>The third case is where you or your accomplishments are the direct object of the sentence and the subject doesn't really matter, e.g.:</p><p>""My designs were awarded the top prize for three years in a row.""</p> <h3>Passive vs. Implied</h3><p>You will hear many conflicting resume tips, but<a href=""http://www.gse.harvard.edu/about/administration/careers/documents/Resumes.pdf"">resume advice</a> sites routinely stress the importance of using active voice. The Harvard Graduate School of Education, for example, puts itsuccinctly:</p><blockquote>""Describe your accomplishments in simple but powerful statements in active voice that emphasize the benefit to your<br>employer.""</blockquote><div title=""Page 2""><div><div><ul> </ul> </div> </div> </div><p>Make sure you understand the difference because some career sites confuse the term ""passive voice"" with ""implied subject."" Sentences that start with a verb like ""Managed a team..."" imply the subject ""I"" but are sometimes erroneously called passive constructions. These are perfectly acceptable, especially in bullet points. Just remember this: if whatever is at the start of your sentence is not the one doing the action, but the one that the action is being done to, that's a passive voice construction. It is a stiff, convoluted style that makes your resume or cover letter instantly forgettable. So find the action and the actors, switch around the order and prove to your new employer how active you really are.</p> <p><b>More info about passive voice:</b></p> <p><a href=""http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/passive-voice/"">Passive Voice, The Writing Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/bigdoc/fullbigdoc.pdf"">Use Active Voice, Federal Plain Language Guidelines, The Plain Language Action and Information Network</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.aie.org/finding-a-career/writing-your-resume/100-great-resume-words.cfm"">Use action words and active voice in your resume to help grab the reader's attention, Adventures in Education</a></p><p><a href=""on http://www.gse.harvard.edu/about/administration/careers/documents/Resumes.pdf"">Career Services Office Quick Tips, Harvard Graduate School of Education</a></p>"Job Search Tips,Job Search from Another City,"<h1><b>How to Search for a Job in Another City</b></h1><p></p><p>Are you looking for a job in another city?

However, that doesn't mean that you are destined to never get a job if you have a gap in your resume. It is possible to overcome and even spin a period of unemployment in a positive way when trying to find a job.</p><h3>Don't try to hide it</h3><div><p>Do not attempt to cover up the period when you weren't working. Lying about dates of employment is a bad idea, as recruiting companies are likely to find out that you lied when they check your references. Some job seekers with long out-of-work periods are tempted to remove dates from their resume altogether, but this is also not a good strategy. According to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/jobs/28search.html"">Susan Ireland</a>, author of ""The Complete Idiots Guide to the Perfect Resume,"" recruiters often become suspicious when they receive a resume with no dates listed.</p></div><h3>Account for time out</h3><div><p>Being up front about gaps in your resume means that you have to explain them. Again, honesty is the best policy. If you took time away from work to take care of your family, you can list this in the personal section of your resume. Similarly, if you left the workforce to recover from an illness or injury, say you did so, but remember that you don't have to go into great detail about your health. The most important thing is not to leave time unaccounted for, as this can be a red flag to a potential employer.</p></div><h3>Accentuate the positive</h3><div><p>If you were engaged in volunteer work, training or consulting projects, then emphasize this productive use of time on your resume and during interviews. Be ready to talk about the experiences you had and the skills that you acquired during this period. Unpaid work can be listed on your resume under a general ""Experience"" heading, but keep in mind that some experts <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kristin-maschka/resume-advice-after-a-car_b_869488.html"">advise against using the term ""volunteer.""</a></p></div><h3>Talking about career gaps during interviews</h3><div><p>During the interview, be open and acknowledge the gap, but focus on communicating your enthusiasm to get back into steady employment. Explain how the skills you gained both before and during your career break are relevant to the role for which you are applying. Learn to tell the story of your period of unemployment as a positive time of self-development, rather than dwelling on the circumstances that kept you out of work.</p></div><h3>Keep a positive attitude</h3><div>Many people expect to struggle to find a job after a career break. As a result, they are discouraged before they even start their search, especially with a gap in their resume. Don't fall into this trap! Update your resume to reflect the experiences you've had since your last position, network with old contacts to find out about opportunities and approach your job search with a positive attitude. Resume gaps are overcome everyday by motivated individuals who have something to offer an employer.</div>"Job Search Tips,Use Social Media in Your Recruiting Strategy,"<p></p><div><div><h1>Use Social Media in Your Recruiting Strategy</h1></div></div><p>If your current recruiting strategy is not pulling in the types of job applicants you want, it's time to make a change. Social media is a tool that companies employ in creative ways to find new hires. If you have not yet tried it out, we offer these reasons to do so and some tips on getting started. <br></p> <h3>Why use social media when recruiting? </h3> <p>The point of using social media in the hiring process is to increase awareness of your openings by reaching a larger audience--one that's already interested in your organization. The more people you reach, the larger your pool of potential new hires becomes, giving you more options. This is especially helpful if you are looking for someone with a specialized skill that might be hard to find. With social media, there is always the chance someone who follows you has the skills you need or knows someone who does.<br></p> <p>Once you have the attention of your target audience, you need to keep it. As<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/sylviavorhausersmith/2013/07/09/three-companies-nailing-social-mobile-for-hr/"">Forbes</a>suggests, your social media posts should engage potential applicants so they come back to read more. Tailor your content for the types of people you would like to hire. For example, write posts that educate followers on both the industry and your company. <br></p> <h3>What kinds of posts should you write? </h3> <p>Linking to informative articles on topics that your ideal new hire should be interested in is a good start. So is posting a link to your job openings. Mix up these updates in order to keep your target audience's attention. <br></p> <p>For example, if you want to show what it's like to work at your company, let your audience get to know the workplace and its staff firsthand. Post pictures and facts about current employees. Ask some of them to take the helm of your company's social media channels for a day for an even more personal touch. <br></p> <p>You might also consider making video clips that show brief interviews with employees or a day-in-the-life of staff members. You can also record a quick tour of the office or have the CEO introduce himself or herself on camera. In general, you can share anything that will put your company in a positive light. <br></p> <h3>How should you get started? </h3> <p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sajjad-masud/social-media-hiring-practices_b_1958974.html"">CEO Sajjad Masud</a> suggests finding out where your ideal new hires spend most of their time online. This could include Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Pinterest, Tumblr, Instagram or Google+. If you do not have the time to update company profiles for every channel, focus on the few that you think will net you the highest returns. Not sure what those are? Ask around within your own company.</p> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/10-creative-recruiting-strategies-for-finding-great-hires-2010-2?op=1"">Business Insider</a>, you can narrow your applicant pool to sincerely interested candidates by inviting them to an event and seeing who shows up. You can use social media to send out invitations, such as through a status update on Facebook, in a group on LinkedIn or in a tweet. This is an easy way to start collecting contact information and resumes from candidates who are interested enough to go somewhere to meet you. <br></p> <p>The use of social media as a recruiting strategy is becoming commonplace. If you haven't tried it yet, you risk being left behind as your competitors use this effective tool to grab the attention of good candidates. Get your social media plan in place before you post your next job ad.</p>"Resumes,Tough Interview Questions,"<h1><b>Tough Interview Questions</b></h1> <p>Preparing interview questions that reveal the potential and personality of a job applicant is a delicate business. Questions should be direct, open-ended and original without being irrelevant, offensive or legally actionable. Perhaps the most important piece of information about the quality of an applicant is how they will work with the existing team. How do you figure that out in just 30 minutes?</p> <p>Here are some tough interview questions that come to us via various resources such as the <a href=""http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/4-interview-questions-get-heart-candidates-potential"">Small Business Administration</a>,along with the characteristics that these questions attempt to reveal.</p> <h3><b>How long before you become frustrated if you are not promoted? </b></h3> <p>This question is trying to discover how ambitious and committed candidates are to the company. Are they there for a paycheck while they look for something better, or do they see themselves in a leadership position? If the latter, are their goals realistic?</p> <h3><b>What happened when a customer or a co-worker became angry with you?</b></h3> <p>It happens, but nobody likes to talk about it. Conflict resolution, responsibility and reliability are all on the line in this answer. Red flags include blaming the customer, grand-standing, refusal to take accountability for the conflict and lack of self-awareness.</p> <h3><b>Have you ever gone home before all the work was done? Can you tell me more about that situation?</b></h3> <p>The first part is a closed-ended, yes/no question. Everything you have read probably recommends that you avoid these kinds of questions, but there is a specific reason for this one. If they try to glide past this question by saying ""No,"" they are either misrepresenting themselves or have never held a position of responsibility. If they answer ""Yes,"" as most will, listen carefully for positive signs of prioritization, communication skills and delegation.</p> <h3>Questions not to ask </h3> <p>There are some questions that are just too tough or that are not fair. The latest information from the <a href=""http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/practices/"">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>specifies that""An employer may not base hiring decisions on stereotypes and assumptions about a person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information."" This seems straight-forward, but it turns out that some very common questions fall within these proscribed guidelines, such as:</p><h3><b>Where were you born and raised?</b></h3><p>This can be considered discriminatory both on the basis of national origin and of U.S. citizenship. Employers <i>can</i> ask if the candidate is legally able to work in the country, but not about the status of their residency.</p><h3><b>Do you have kids?</b></h3><p>An innocent and personable question outside the workplace, but candidates who don't make it to the next round can point to this as a discriminatory question based on age or parental status.</p><h3><b>Do you normally take a vacation around the holidays?</b></h3><p>Considering that so many companies operate 24/7 these days, many need employees to be available for customer support around the clock and around the calendar. Asking an applicant to specify which holidays they celebrate is a subtle form of discrimination based on religion. Instead ask about specific dates when the company needs coverage.</p> <p>Like prepping for a good meal, preparing tough but revealing interview questions takes thoughtful dedication and patience. By starting with examples of common situations on the job and likely problems the candidate will face, the tough questions will write themselves.</p>"Interviews,How to Prepare for an Interview,"<h2>How to Prepare for an Interview</h2>The interview is your chance to meet candidates face to face and get a feel for how they might fit into your organization. To make the most of this opportunity, you need to prepare. Here are some basic tips that employers can use to prepare for an interview.<h3><b>Know What You're Looking For</b></h3><div>The first step in interview preparation is to know what you want in terms of skills, experience and personality. Make a list of characteristics that you are looking for in your ideal candidate.<h3><b>Review Resumes</b></h3><div>You should be familiar with the candidate's resume and cover letter before the interview begins. You'd be surprised by how many interviewers use the interview to read a candidate's resume thoroughly for the first time. Flicking through application details during the interview wastes time and also creates an unprofessional environment. Remember, the interview is a also chance for the candidate to assess your organization.</div><h3><b>Address Concerns</b></h3><div>Highlight parts of the resume that you want to ask the candidate about. When you go into an interview, you should know exactly what your concerns are about each candidate. By the end of the interview, there should be no unexplained red flags remaining on a candidate's resume. Sounds basic, but this is another one some interviewers don't do.</div><h3><b>Prepare Questions</b></h3><div>Asking the right questions is essential. Prepare a list beforehand so that you don't dry up in the middle of the interview. Try to use open-ended questions that encourage the applicant to talk about their skills and experiences using specific examples. For example, you could ask questions such as ""Tell me about a time when you successfully worked as part of a team"" to find out about the candidate's teamwork experience.</div><h3><b>Set the Schedule</b></h3><div>Schedule enough time to get all the information you need from each candidate without having to rush or skip over key details. Plan to spend a few minutes between interviews making notes, as you won't remember everything about each candidate, especially if you are interviewing more than a few people for the job.</div><div><br></div><div>By following these tips, you can conduct a professional interview that supplies the information you need to choose the best candidate. Next time your organization is hiring, give yourself plenty of time to prepare for an interview so you can make the right decision.</div></div>"Career,Tips for Executive Recruiters,"<h1><b>Tips for Executive Recruiters</b></h1><p></p><p></p><p>You're hiring a top-level executive, and it's not something your small or mid-sized organization typically does. We have good news. Right now happens to be a really great time for organizations of all sizes to recruit successful, veteran executives.</p><p></p><p>Common sense says the largest, richest companies attract the best talent. The truth is that <a href=""http://www.inc.com/magazine/19990601/802.html/1"">small businesses today can offer executives a business environment that their larger counterparts cannot</a>. Smaller companies explore new and interesting business niches and are usually more flexible and far less tied down to a policy structure. Overall, they represent a fresh opportunity for growth.</p><p></p><p>When money is not a critical issue, many executives prefer to work on something they care about in lieu of bringing home a huge paycheck.</p><p></p><p>Here are some tips and tricks to help you attract top-of-the-line executives.</p><p></p><h3>Keep an eye on downsizing companies </h3>This is a great way to find unemployed talent. Look to business news sources for information, <a href=""http://www.inc.com/articles/1998/01/14567.html"">as well as organizations that help displaced executives</a>.<p></p><p></p><h3>Be ready to accommodate people </h3>If you can almost satisfy a potential executive, be willing to work with them to get them on board. If they are asking for more than you can afford, consider offering them a part-time or telecommuting position. Clark Hubbard of CSI Data Systems, for example, <a href=""http://www.inc.com/articles/1999/10/19252.html"">needed a CFO but couldn't afford the one he wanted</a>. He took an innovative approach and managed to make the hire at a lower pay by offering the CFO the use of his offices to meet with other clients.<br><h3>Network with executives </h3>Networking gives you the best opportunity to meet with high level executives, but you will have to change your usual networking strategy in order to meet the right people. Attend local events at museums, fundraisers and conferences. Many communities also have business networking groups that cater to executives and other high ranking company officials. Online networking over social sites such as LinkedIn also offers an opportunity to connect with executives on a one-on-one level. <br><h3>Write the right job description </h3>Tailoring a job description for an executive is a bit different than writing your standard job description. Include the actual job title in the description title. Instead of listing desired skills, experienceand abilities, write your job description to show how you define success at your organization and the overall expectations of the position. Executives are success-driven and competitive by nature and will be drawn to descriptions that focus on this aspect of the position. Use actual success factors that illustrate what you want the new executive to accomplish. If you want to increase your current sales by 25 percent, this needs to go in your description. <br><h3>Make your offer stand out from the crowd </h3>What makes your company attractive to a topexecutive? The answer should beyour corporate culture and the possibility to make a difference. If you want to entice an executive, you have to illustrate why they should take a chance on working for you. Whatever it is that makes your culture unique, this needs to be included in your job description and in your conversations with them.<p></p><p></p><p>Smaller companies have a lot to offer besides money. The excitement of a new venture in a promising field, the flexibility, the open culture. A young business is ready to grow, and many executives want to be a part of that growth. The value that veteran executives can bring to an inexperienced company is incalculable and well worth the time they may take to acquire.</p>"Career,Do you Have the Right Job Title?,"<h1><b>Do You Have the Right Job Title?</b><br></h1><p>The most important element of a job ad is its title. The job title is the first thing a potential employee notices about the job listing, so it should be specific and accurately identify the available position. The right words will not only draw the right applicants, but they will improve visibility in search engines.</p><p>The best way to create a job title is to determine a relative keywordthis will be the word used in searches on both the Internet in general and on job search engines such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>.</p><p><a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/225908"">Entrepreneur</a>suggests doing an in-depth job analysis. This requires listing both the mental and physical tasks involved, the reasoning for the job and all the required qualifications for the vacant position before creating the ad. Also, review the <a href=""http://www.occupationalinfo.org"">U.S. Department of Labors Dictionary of Occupational Titles</a> (DOT)for additional keywords to add to the job analysis. </p><p>Other factors that can be used in determining keywords include:</p><ul><li>What job titles are similar companies using?</li><li>What phrases are job seekers searching for?</li><li>Are applicants searching for industry-specific terms?</li><li>Is the job title relative to a geographic location?</li></ul><p></p><p>Analyzing keywords with a free tool, such as <a href=""https://adwords.google.com/ko/KeywordPlanner/Home"">Google Keyword Planner</a>, can provide detailed information on which words are searched more often while also suggesting others that might prove useful.<br></p><h3><b>Four Tips for Great Job Post Titles</b></h3><p></p><ol start=""1""><li><b>Keep it simple:</b> What position needs filling? Now is not the time for creative sales jargon. Do not abbreviate titles, or if the job has an acronym, only include the acronym after youve listed the title name.</li><li><b>Get specific: </b>The more specific the job title, the more likely applicants with that specific skillset are to see the posting and apply.</li><li><b>Make it reflect the jobs scope or responsibility:</b> Is this a part-time or temporary position? Does the job require a certain skill? Be sure to mention this in the title. Part-time or Spanish speaking positions open up the application to a whole other range of applicants who might not normally apply.</li><li><b>Indicate the required level of skill: </b>What separates a Junior from a Senior software developer is years of experience and breadth of knowledge. ""Director"" or ""Manager"" will appeal to different applicants, as well as those searching for those specific jobs via Internet search results.</li></ol><h3><b>Four Things NOT to Do</b></h3><ol start=""1""><li><b>Use too many keywords: </b>Using too many keywords is considered ""stuffing"" and can make the post look spammy and also lead to its deletion by job board moderators.</li><li><b>Use deceptive titles: </b>A title that does not coincide with a relative description takes away a companys credibility in the eyes of job applicants. It also confuses search engines, making it impossible to search and route traffic to the post.</li><li><b>Ask questions, include dollar amounts or list ""No Experience Required"":</b> These are all ways some companies mislead people and will keep qualified applicants away.</li><li><b>Use weird formatting and special characters: </b>Not only does this look like spam from all angles, but its also unprofessional. Matching search terms will be unpredictable.</li></ol><p></p><p>The body of the posting should include the job title as well as other related words in order to increase the relevance of the post. This will not only make it easier for qualified applicants to find the job listing, but will also increase the postings job board and search engine visibility.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Career,Do Classified Job Postings Work?,"<h1><b>Do Classified Job Postings Work?</b></h1><p></p><p>For employers, finding the right recruitment method is important for finding the right employee. In a world that's increasingly digital, old methods of hiring employees, such as classified job postings, are not the go-tos they once were. For decades classified job postings were a popular option for employers to seek out new talent, but in this day and age, do classified job postings even work? </p><p></p><p>With general internet job listing sites and niche recruitment sites gaining popularity, employers now have better, faster methods of recruiting than the traditional print classified job postings of yesteryear. But that doesnt necessarily mean classified job postings are no longer useful.</p><p></p><h3><b>Out With the Old, In With the New</b></h3><p></p><p>According to a Sources of Hire (SOH) <a href=""http://www.careerxroads.com/news/SourcesOfHire2013.pdf"">study by CareerXroads</a>, the number one source of hires for 2012 was referrals, with no distinction between employee referrals or non-employee referrals. Referrals made up 24.5 percent of hires in 2012. Print accounted for just 2.3 percent, although it did show a slight tick upward. Print rose from 2 percent in 2010 to the 2.3 percent in 2012.</p><p></p><p>The Newspaper Association of America <a href=""http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/business-news/the-biz-blog/100565/classified-ad-revenue-down-70-percent-in-10-years-with-one-bright-spot/"">reported in 2009</a> that recruitment advertising in print newspapers was one-tenth of what it was during the year 2000. Likely the economy, as well as the digital boom, contributed to the fall.</p><p></p><p>Online classified websites such as Craig's List and search engines such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>are becoming more popular to both employers and job seekers. Not surprisingly, many print sources where classified job postings are listed also have online job boards that duplicate their ads, making it easier for employers and potential employees to connect as print becomes more obsolete. </p><p></p><p>Employers are less likely to seek out potential employees through print alone for reasons that include:</p><p></p><ul type=""disc""> <li>Print classified job listings are limited geographically.</li> <li>Lack of filtering process for resumes. Employers must look at each resume received. </li> <li><a href=""http://www.shiftgig.com/articles/classified-ads-print-or-online"">Cost-to-time ratio</a> of listing with print classifieds versus online classifieds. Print classifieds can cost upwards of $100 dollars or more and must be sent, accepted, and printed, which takes time. Online job boards are sometimes free and take significantly less time to post. </li> </ul><p></p><h3>Help Wanted Advantages</h3><p>There are advantages to using print classified job postings. Employers who are seeking local candidates might want to utilize print job postings. Employers can also feel assured that their print classified job posting wont disappear in a sea of other listings, as sometimes happens on online job boards and job posting sites. Small-town employers might benefit more from print classified job postings, as would employers who are hiring in a community with high newspaper readership numbers.</p><p></p><p>So do classified job postings work? Yes, but they have limitations. And though classified job postings have seen a decline due to the digital disruption of online job sites, they are still being utilized, albeit on a far smaller scale.</p><h1></h1><p><a href=""http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?sd=2/20/2013&id=pr740&ed=12/31/2013""></a></p><p><a href=""http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?sd=2/20/2013&id=pr740&ed=12/31/2013""></a></p>"Career,The New Age of Recruiting,"<h2>The New Age of Recruiting</h2> <p>Perhaps you've heard the saying that the larger the database of potential applicants, the stronger the recruitment brand within your company? No? Not that common of a saying? Well, in any case, it's no longer true. Today it's easy to grow a candidate database with thousands of applicants, but there are times when none of those applicants is a worthy choice. The New Age of Recruiting is an ever-changing landscape where the goal is not to amass applicants, but to drive in the very best candidates for the positions available. It's a competitive market and only the very best recruiters will land the top candidates. </p> <h3>Recruiting isn't cheap</h3> <p>Studies conducted by <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2013/05/23/corporate-recruitment-transformed-new-breed-of-service-providers/"">Forbes</a> indicate that businesses are spending over $3,300 per hire. In fact, the same study indicates that businesses have increased their recruitment budgets by as much as six percent in order to find the ideal candidate for each position available. Each year, U.S. companies spend $72 billion on a variety of services and technologies to help with their talent search. In the new age of hiring applicants, the ability of a company to stay competitive links directly to investments made in HR. Businesses are spending big money to lure talent.</p> <h3>Technology at the helm </h3> <p>Everything from software focused on navigating thousands of applications in minutes to cloud-based recruiting technology that allows for easy sharing of applicant data is available. The presence of technology is growing within the recruitment world. This is good, because technology reduces the time-cost of screening candidates. Technology also allows for applicants from a worldwide database to connect.</p> <h3>Liability remains a factor</h3> <p>Employers face liability concerns thanks to regulations. Securing signatures for background checks and for reference checks is sometimes necessary. As the <a href=""http://www.nd.gov/hrms/managers/guide/reference.html"">State of North Dakota</a> states, the authority to request a verbal reference remains limited. That means applicants must be informed of your desire to conduct reference checks and should be given full disclosure of the types of information that the hiring manager plans to share. Some states have laws limiting the type of information that can be gathered from references, especially about criminal activity. Misleading an applicant or breaking their privacy can land a human resource department in hot water.</p> <h3>Recruitment is all about the strategy</h3> <p>Some companies tailor job ads and recruiting strategies around the specific generation of applicants they are targeting. For example, Generation Y is less interested in higher pay and more interested in a flexible work schedule and the ability to use their cell phones at work and at home. This is very different from older generations that focused on health care, retirement benefits and bigger paychecks. Knowing this, employers are targeting applicants with benefits designed to meet their needs. Dogs at work, exercise balls for chairs and in-house childcare are all amenities for a new generation.</p> Within the world of recruiting, these factors are becoming commonplace. As a hiring manager or employer, it is critical to ensure that the business has a recruitment plan that is going to drive the right talent to their hiring page. This new age of recruiting is one filled with strategy, technology, regulations and competition."Resumes,Tricks to Finding Qualified Candidates,"<h1>Tricks to Finding Qualified Candidates</h1> <p>Finding well-qualified candidates is one of the the most challenging parts of any hiring manager's job. It's easy to place an ad and wait for resumes to roll in. It's time-consuming to sift through unqualified job applications to find that one desirable candidate. We did some research and compiled this list of tips. If all of this seems like common sense--great. You're doing it right. But we hope there's a nugget or two in here for you to take away.</p> <h3>Utilize resources and tools available to you</h3> <p>Thousands of jobs across the U.S. are sitting unfilled, as you might have read in the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/28/business/smallbusiness/even-with-high-unemployment-some-small-businesses-struggle-to-fill-positions.html?pagewanted=all"">New York Times</a>. The reason isn't lack of talent, but rather that companies have a difficult time recruiting the right types of people. This sounds obvious, but make sure you're utilizing third party services that give you the best bang for your buck. A job search engine such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> is one example.</p> <p>Some businesses find that allowing a third party to handle the collection of resumes and applications is cost effective. Third party tools allow businesses to locate key candidates based on keywords included in applications, such as specific educational achievements, previous positions or experience related to the position. If you have the means, outsource the initial screening process. It will save you time.</p> <h3>Utilize government services</h3> <p>Did you know that many economic agencies within states provide resources to help companies find qualified job candidates? For example, the <a href=""http://www.floridajobs.org/business-growth-and-partnerships/for-employers/recruit-qualified-candidates"">Florida Department of Economic Opportunity</a> provides employers with resources to help hire veterans, seniors and those looking for green jobs. These services minimize costs and help the company meet specific employee hiring goals.</p><h3>Turn to Your Current Staff</h3><p>Current employees provide one of the richest sources of applicants. If employees like their jobs, they are likely to refer family and friends to open positions. Many businesses even give them an incentive to do so. To generate referrals from staff, install an employee referral program. Encourage staff to refer candidates for key positions and then offer an incentive if that candidate is hired. Even non-monetary incentives work well, such as providing public recognition, hosting a luncheon and providing positive feedback for such referrals during performance reviews. Creating a culture of respect and a positive work environment encourages such referrals.</p> <h3>Do's and don'ts of applicant screening</h3> <p>It's important to avoid mistakes in your search for the ideal applicant.</p> <p></p><ul><li>Don't be vague always be specific in job ads. List the very specific requirements you have if they are hard qualifications without any flexibility. Short posts with vague descriptions waste time.<br></li><li>Do make the application process more intense by requiring personal investment from the applicants. Instead of only requesting a resume, for instance, require the applicant to take the time to craft a personalized narrative about his or her experience. This weeds out less-than-serious applicants.<br></li><li>Do list the job title, but don't leave out the description. Many applicants don't realize they hold qualifications for different titles. It's a good idea to be specific about the tasks the applicant must be able to perform so they can see if they're a match.<br></li><li>Don't forget to give them a reason. Some companies post job ads but forget that top talent needs to be lured in. To find qualified candidates, dig deeper by stating what your company has to offer. Benefits, room for advancement, a competitive career advantage, increased responsibilities, a good salary and even free snacks and drinks are all going to draw in better candidates.<br></li></ul><p></p> <p>It's not always a numbers game. The best applicants for any position tend not to focus on the amount you can pay them, but the role they will play within the company and how much they will enjoy the work. To get those qualified candidates, put yourself in their shoes.</p>"Career,Tips for Checking References,"<h1>Tips for Checking References</h1> <p>Checking references is necessary, and some human resource managers find it to be a tedious task. It takes time to get hold of someone, or the reference often doesn't offer anything helpful in making your hiring decision. Here are a few helpful tips to make the process of checking references less of a pain.</p> <h3>Use the phone</h3> <p>Forget the written reference check as an initial step. According to the good folks over at<a href=""http://www.nd.gov/hrms/managers/guide/reference.html"">North Dakota Human Resource Management Services</a>, the most effective means of gathering information is over the phone. It cuts down on time significantly, and it allows the reviewer to listen to the inflection and tone of voice the individual is using, both of which are very helpful in making decisions about character and honesty.</p> <h3>Dig deeper when references don't talk</h3><div>Sometimes a reference simply will not answer questions. As <a href=""http://hrs.appstate.edu/sites/hrs.appstate.edu/files/referencecheckingtips.pdf"">Appalachian State University</a> notes, the burden of proof is on the applicant. Turn back to the applicant with a request for better references. References reluctant to talk may have reasons. If the candidate cannot provide better references, move on.</div> <h3>Get it done now</h3> <p>The most efficient way to handle checking references is to get the process done now, as soon as possible after the interview. The person who did the interview should conduct the reference check, too. This ensures that the verification of information is easily shared between the reference, hiring manager and the applicant.</p> <h3>Know whom to call</h3> <p>It's also important to not waste time. There's little benefit to contacting close personal references; references such as parents, friends and other family members are less likely to offer usable information. These individuals are likely to embellish information or may not have any idea what the applicant's work skills are. Ask applicants to only submit references for a variety of people, not including family and friends.</p> <h3>Check at least three references</h3> <p>Resume padding is a common problem associated with the application process. Verifying as much information on the resume and application as possible ensures the candidate has been accurate and honest. The best way to do this is to check at least three references and look for common errors or omissions. This gives hiring managers verification without wasting too much time.</p> <p>As a hiring manager, checking references is a critical component of the job. It allows for the gathering of additional information, and it also ensures that the applicant is being honest, putting the company at less of a risk of hiring the wrong candidate. This doesn't have to be a challenging process. Follow the advice above.</p>"Resumes,Passive Recruitment Strategies,"<div><div><div><h1>Passive Recruitment Strategies</h1></div></div></div><p>Companies often rely on passive recruitment strategies to ensure that they have a steady pool of candidates to choose from when jobs become available. Whereas the hurry-up method of recruiting and hiring when a job opens up is common, it is not always the most effective long-term strategy for an HR department. </p><p><a href=""http://talent.linkedin.com/blog/index.php/2012/08/passive-talent-strategy/ "">Mark Freeman</a> is a LinkedIn Recruitment Product Consulting Manager, and he is responsible for helping customers use the LinkedIn business networking site to their greatest advantage. According to Freeman, the most common excuse for neglecting a long-term passive recruitment strategy is a lack of resources. This is unfortunate. A company doesn't necessarily need a large recruitment budget to attract new employees on a regular basis; in fact, free resources such as online media and mobile applications can play a large part in passive recruitment techniques. </p><h3><b>Passive recruitment tools</b></h3><div><p>Here are some simple tools with which a company can build a passive recruitment strategy:</p><ul><li>Social media<br></li><li>A company recruitment page</li><li>Industry conventions</li><li>A trained recruitment team<br></li></ul><p>The key to becoming an attractive company that many talented people hope to work for is success. Low employee turnover helps, too. If turnover is relatively high, it becomes more difficult to bring in top talent that can help the company become stronger. Keeping your employees happy and productive is actually the most important strategy for passive recruitment. Why? Talented individuals who work at your company and enjoy job security, as well as a rewarding position among a positive group of people, can provide a steady stream of like-minded people who want to work there, too.</p><h3><b>How does social media help with recruitment?</b></h3><p>Social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are important resources for passive recruitment. These and other social media websites are online networking platforms that can forge relationships between businesses and prospective hires. Put a professional face on your media accounts and encourage conversation between your company and its followers. Share ideas about advertising, sales and products. Think of LinkedIn or Twitter as an online, global Chamber of Commerce and use it to put your company's best face forward. The more people with whom you connect, the more potential hires will be attracted to your company. An online company recruitment page and an active, relevant Twitter or Facebook account help to create a positive company image.</p><h3><b>Trained recruitment teams and industry conventions</b></h3><p>Regular attendance at industry meetings, events and conventions ensures that people (including potential employees) have a face to put to the company name. Be genuine, kind and open to answering questions and very liberal about sharing your business cards. At the same time, keep a portion of your staff <a href=""http://www.ere.net/2010/12/10/4-passive-candidate-recruiting-strategies/"">trained to deal with recruitment</a> in terms of sharing company information, updating social media sites and keeping active on your LinkedIn account. They can also maintain the website and add any current jobs to the website when necessary. </p><p>The purpose of passive recruitment strategies are twofold: to ensure that top talent finds you when it needs employment and to weather a fluctuating economy. Use the tools listed above and focus on your long-term recruitment strategy; your company will be stronger for it.</p></div>"Interviews,What Questions Can I ask job Candidates?,"<h2>What Questions Can I Ask Job Candidates in California?</h2><p>Interviewing job candidates is a crucial stage in the hiring process. The interview allows you to determine whether or not a particular candidate is a good fit for your organization. However, employers must be careful not to cross the line when interviewing job candidates in the state of California, as many seemingly innocuous questions are in fact illegal to ask in a job interview. Read on to find out which questions you are allowed to ask, and which ones should be avoided during the interview stage of the recruitment process. As a rule of thumb, questions that are illegal to ask in California are generally a bad idea to ask anywhere, for legal and ethical reasons.</p><h3>What is appropriate and what is not?</h3><p>The rules governing allowable interview questions in the state of California are spelled out in the <a href=""http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/res/docs/publications/dfeh-161.pdf"">California Department of Fair Employment and Housing Fact Sheet</a>. (If you do not work for a California business, your state probably has one of these as well.) Hiring managers in California are not allowed to ask anything that may lead them to discriminate on the basis of age, ethnicity, gender, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, religion or marital status. Here are a few examples of questions they can and cannot ask during an interview:</p><p><b>Questions they can ask:</b></p><ul><li>It's OK to ask for a candidate's name, but asking for her maiden name is illegal because it can reveal ethnicity and is not necessary for the hiring process.</li><li>You can ask about the languages spoken by the candidate only if this information is relevant to the job.</li><li>You can require a candidate to undergo a physical or psychological assessment only if it is relevant to the role and only after you have made a conditional offer of employment. The assessment must be applied to all employees who are hired in that role; you can't require it for some individuals but not others.</li><li>You can only ask about previous convictions if they are relevant to the job.</li><li>You can ask for references from previous employers or other relevant persons who can vouch for the applicant's character.</li></ul><p><b>Questions you cannot ask</b></p><div><ul><li>You may not ask the candidate their age, either directly or indirectly, by asking when they graduated from school or college.</li><li>You may not ask about candidates' birthplaces, ancestry or citizenship status, although you can ask about their legal right to work in the United States.</li><li>You may not ask candidates about their religion or ask about religious holidays they observe. However, you may spell out the days that you expect employees to work.</li><li>You may not ask candidates about their marital or family status or their plans for childbearing. You must also not ask a candidate whether she is pregnant. You can ask whether the candidate is able to work overtime or travel for work, if these are likely to be requirements of the job.</li><li>You can't ask about disabilities, but you can ask about the candidate's ability to perform specific tasks involved in the role.</li></ul></div><p>For more advice about conducting an effective interview without overstepping the legal restrictions, check out this<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/allbusiness/AB8518555_primary.html"">NY Times article</a>.</p><div>The general rule for interviewing job candidates without breaking the law is to keep all questions relevant to the job. Only ask for information that you need to make your decision. If a candidate offers information about their race, religion or family situation, move on without engaging in discussion. Keep the interview focused on the candidate's professional experience and skills. This will ensure that you get all the information you need without breaking the law.</div>"Resumes,Sample Resumes That Work,"<h1><b>Sample Resumes That Work</b></h1><p></p><p></p><p>Your resume showcases your work experience, skills, achievements and accolades.

These interview tips for new graduates should increase your confidence and improve your chances of getting the position you want. Good luck!<br></p> <p><b>1. Research the company.</b> You might have thought your days of doing homework were over, but they're not. Your most important assignment is to research the company. Make sure you understand its history, mission and structure, as well as what your job would entail. <br></p> <p><b>2. Make a good first impression. </b>Dress conservatively, keeping makeup, jewelry and perfume to a minimum. Shave or groom facial hair, and keep any tattoos or piercings hidden. You should also make sure you arrive a few minutes early so you are not rushing into the lobby looking anxious and disheveled. <br></p> <p><b>3. Draw on your experience as a college student. </b>You might not have much experience with a career yet, but you have likely learned a lot in classes, clubs, internships and part-time jobs. Keep in mind the lessons you have taken from college and use them when answering questions during interviews. <br></p> <p><b>4. Come prepared with documents.</b> Even though the interviewer already has your resume on file, that doesn't mean he or she will have it printed out and ready to look at. Show that you are extra prepared by bringing a file folder or small briefcase that contains a copy of your resume, writing samples (if relevant) and a notepad and pen so you can take notes. <br></p> <p><b>5. Prepare answers to common questions. </b>Interviews are much easier when you already know the answers. Make sure you know your greatest strengths and weaknesses, for example. If you don't have any previous professional experience, base your answer on the skills you can bring to this position.<br></p> <p><b>6. Record your practice responses. </b>According to this good advice from<a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2013/05/14/5-quick-interview-tips-for-new-grads"">U.S. News & World Report</a>, you can work on reducing filler words and sounds when you see and hear yourself answer questions. Once you know how you come across during interviews, you can sound more professional. <br></p> <p><b>7. Be prepared to explain weaknesses in your job application.</b> If you were fired from your last job or have gaps in your resume, the interviewer will want to address these possible issues. Keep them from becoming deal-breakers by explaining why they occurred and what you have learned from them that will help you in your next position. <br></p> <p><b>8. Focus on ways you can improve the company. </b>If you have any examples of ways you added value to the places you worked or volunteered at in school, bring them up when appropriate. For example, if you increased profits, reduced expenses in some way or even simply solved an important problem for your boss, let the interviewer know about it.<br></p> <p><b>9. Ask questions.</b> Most interviewers make it a point to find out if job applicants have any questions for them, so make sure you have some prepared. According to <a href=""http://andychan.opcd.wfu.edu/2013/06/top-10-interview-tips-for-new-college-graduates/"">Andy Chan, Wake Forest University's Vice President for Personal and Career Development</a>, this is a good way to show that you did your homework on the company. Just don't ask questions that are clearly answered on the company website.<br></p> <p><b>10. Show your enthusiasm for the job.</b> You can do this by sending an email or even a card in the mail to show your appreciation for the chance to interview for the position. This is one of those interview tips most new graduates have probably heard before, but that's because it is important to finish strong, no matter where you are in your career.</p>"Interviews,How to Prepare for a Job Interview,"<h1>How to Prepare for a Job Interview</h1> <p>Congrats! You landed the interview. Now you just need to impress them enough to make it to the second round. In addition to cleaning yourself up and making a copy of your resume (which you already know you should do!), determined applicants must go a little farther to impress a hiring manager. Your goal is for the manager to remember you over all of the other candidates for the job. To do that, you'll need to be thorough and think creatively.</p> <h3>Go beyond the basics when researching the company</h3> <p>To prepare for the job interview, research the company thoroughly. Look at everything from the company's website to its Wiki page. Then, go deeper. Check its Twitter and Facebook statuses. Read the company's latest press releases and articles that mention it by name. You can use this intel to show interest in the organization, and that will go a long way in impressing the hiring manager. As the <a href=""http://www.va.gov/jobs/hiring/interview.asp"">US Department of Veterans Affairs</a> suggests, you can also talk to other people within the organization beforehand to find out what's happening.</p><h3>Clear those pages</h3><p> </p><p>Employers will check your social media pages to find out as much as they can about you even long before you step foot in the door for the interview. Get rid of those pictures on your account of your partying Saturday nights. Ensure you are not talking bad about the company in your status posts, either. As reported by the<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/20/employers-use-facebook-to-pre-screen-applicants_n_1441289.html"">Huffington Post</a>, as many as 32 percent of employers use social media websites to research applicants.</p> <h3>Get revved up</h3> <p>Often times, it takes an interviewee about five or more minutes to really warm up and let his or her guard down during an interview. To make a difference to the hiring manager, be ready to go before you get in the office. Review your resume a few minutes prior to walking in the door. Be ready with a 60-second ""commercial"" about yourself to answer the ""tell me about yourself"" question. Reviewing beforehand allows you to be ready to go at 100 percent as soon as you sit down.</p><p>An easy tip from <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/here-there-and-everywhere/201206/10-ways-ace-job-interview"">PsychologyToday.com's</a> Stephanie Sarkis, PhD, is to simply act like you are confident even if you are not. In other words, fake it. Keep telling yourself, in your mind, that you are confident. Soon enough, you will be.</p> <h3>Don't forget the basics</h3> <p>Even with these tips, you still need to do the basics of preparing for a job interview. Remember the following:</p><p></p><ul><li>Dress professionally and with distinction.<br></li><li>Arrive at least 10 minutes early.<br></li><li>Be organized and neat with a notepad, your resume on quality paper and a list of your references.<br></li><li>Always be honest. Hiring managers receive training on how to spot signs of deception or misleading information.<br></li><li>Always be positive. You want to leave the interview on a positive note, talking about good things.<br></li><li>Downplay the reason that you are leaving your current employer and never bad mouth anyone.<br></li></ul><p></p><p></p> By taking the time to prepare for the job interview, not only will you do a better job once you arrive, but you will also feel more confident in your abilities. Being confident, concise and clear can make a big difference in any hiring manager's willingness to interview you again."Career,Feeling Lost? Take an Aptitude Test,"<h1><b>Feeling Lost? Take an Aptitude Test</b></h1> <p>Aptitude tests are an underused resource for job seekers and those seeking a career change. In fact, you could argue that a great deal of unhappiness in the workplace might be prevented if job seekers started out by deciding what they wanted to do and persistently pursued that goal instead of feeling pressured to take whatever job was available at the moment.</p><p>A Gallup poll revealed that <a href=""http://businessjournal.gallup.com/content/162953/tackle-employees-stagnating-engagement.aspx"">70 percent of employees</a> are either ""not engaged"" or ""actively disengaged"" with their work. That's more than two out of three people you have ever worked with. The costs are staggering, both for economic development on a national level and in terms of stress-related illnesses on a personal level.</p><p>But because of high unemployment numbers, people are staying longer in jobs they don't like.

This in-depth test is used to categorize students by personality and business skills. Because this is a complex test with results that require interpretation, the <a href=""http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/take-the-mbti-instrument/"">Myers & Briggs foundation</a> recommends having the results assessment administered by certified practitioners.

That's why we're spotlighting these 10 growing occupations. Take a look at this list.You might notice a pattern. Many of them are in the technology and healthcare industries. That might not be a bad place for you to be, too.<br></p> <p><b>1.

Biomedical engineers do everything from crafting devices to improving processes in the medical community.<br></p> <p><b>2. Home Health Aide: </b>If you like the idea of caring for patients in their home, this career should appeal to you. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45fmhd/3-home-health-aides/"">Forbes</a> has reported that the demand for home health aides will rise by about 69 percent by 2020. For many people, this career is a way into the healthcare industry, since it involves light medical duties.

Personal Care Aide:</b> The <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_103.htm"">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> estimates that this career will grow by about 70 percent.

With fewer positions available at the highest levels, you have to get creative to locate companies that are hiring. And as you know, most jobs for executives are not advertised on job boards. For an executive job search, you have to use networking and shoe leather to find a job that fits your skill set and salary requirements. Here are several useful tips for executives looking for a new job.</p> <h3><b>Get Attention </b></h3><p></p> <p>There are many ways to make yourself more visible to recruiters and headhunters. Executives can get attention by offering their expertise and knowledge to others. You can join a speaker's bureau, write a book or an ebook, write articles for trade journals and business magazines, start a blog about your business or participate in discussions on networking websites such as LinkedIn. If writing isn't your forte, hire a ghostwriter.</p> <h3><b>Use LinkedIn</b></h3><p></p> <p>LinkedIn is the premier social media website for professionals. You should complete your profile, add a head shot and participate in relevant discussions. You can also use LinkedIn to join or start special interest groups, look for jobs and research companies for which you may want to work. With a paid subscription, you can connect with people you have no connection with via the InMail feature.</p> <h3><b>Ask for Help</b></h3><p></p> <p>Even executives can use a helping hand. It's useful to tell people you know that you are looking for a new job. It's also good to ask friends and colleagues if they know of any job openings that require your skills. Ask for the names of one or two contacts at a company, and ask if you can use them as a referral. Another option is to ask for introductions to a few people who work at a company in which you are interested.</p> <h3><b>Create a Plan of Action</b></h3><p></p> <p>Finding an executive level job is more than just looking at senior or C-level job boards. Experts recommend <a href=""https://www.bluesteps.com/blog/how-do-i-start-an-executive-job-search.aspx"">looking for a job</a> as if it was a full-time job. This means setting up a schedule for what you will do to search for a job. This might include phoning or emailing X number of contacts each day or writing X number of blog posts each month to improve your online presence. With an action plan, you stay motivated.</p> <h3><b>Leadership Initiative</b></h3><p></p> <p>This is a new way for executives to conduct a job search. A <a href=""http://www.theladders.com/career-advice/career-management-tips-executive"">leadership initiative</a> is a one- or two-page document that describes your accomplishments as a manager and leader. It illustrates what you did and what the results were. Using metrics will solidify your business successes.</p> <h3><b>Network Online and Off</b></h3> <p>Many executives today find jobs though networking. In fact, this is the best way to locate unadvertised jobs. When you attend official networking events through trade associations, business networking groups or conferences, it's important to have a script ready. This script is a short <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2013/02/04/the-perfect-elevator-pitch-to-land-a-job/"">elevator pitch</a> that describes your expertise and how you can help a company. It's important to be specific as well as concise.</p> <h3><b>Contact Headhunters</b></h3><p></p> <p>Although headhunters often look for executives to recruit, it doesn't hurt to contact the top recruiters and headhunters in your industry and let them know you're available.</p> <p>For anyone looking for a senior position, its important to have a plan for doing an executive job search. As a business professional, you understand that strategic planning is the best way to accomplish any goal. In this case, the goal is to find an executive level job. </p>"Interviews,Job Openings for Teens,"<h2>Job Openings for Teens</h2><div><p></p></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><p></p><p>In an economy that has forced otherwise qualified college students and retirees to apply for traditional high school jobs, teenagers are finding it increasingly difficult to land gainful employment. Given the current competition from seemingly better qualified applicants,teenage applicantsmust put in a great amount of effort in order to convince employers that they are capable of being reliable employees. Fortunately, it's still possible to score a great job. You'll just want to keep the following in mind as you sift through the available job openings for teens.</p><h3><strong>Volunteer Experience</strong></h3><p>There are few things interviewers like to see more than teenage applicants willing to show initiative. The easiest way to prove your willingness to go the extra mile? Rack up a few volunteer hours. Whether you assist in a nursing home or pull weeds at the local park, you'll gain valuable marketability,not to mention a handful of references. Also, if you're currently in the midst of the great college hunt, you can think of this as killing two birds with one stone. Volunteer experience is an important part of any college application. <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/the-scholarship-coach/2013/04/25/community-service-can-pay-off-with-college-scholarships"">U.S. News and World Report</a> points toYouth Action Net and the Partnership for Public Service Fellowship as just two of many organizationsoffering generous scholarships to students with exceptional volunteer backgrounds.</p><h3><strong>Top-Notch References</strong></h3><p>If you lack volunteer experience or past employment, your best bet for gaining work will involve your ability to provide decent references. Have you built up a good rapport with one of your teachers? How about a coach or adviser? Any of these individuals has the potential to make an excellent reference. Best avoided for the required reference list: anyone in your immediate family or circle of friends. Ideally, your reference will have witnessed you taking responsible action of some sort and can report on it to the investigating interviewer. Be sure to notify anyone you include on the reference list, as some people prefer to have time to prepare their thoughts before answering recruiter questions.</p><h3><strong>Interview Confidence</strong></h3><p>The recruiter at your business of interest checked out your applicationand liked it! You've cleared the first hurdle on the path to high school employment, but you're nowhere near the finish line. For many teens, the interview is by far the most nerve-wracking portion of the process. Unfortunately, if you are dreading your interview, your nervousness might show. Your interviewerrecognizes just how difficult the interview process can be for inexperienced teens and will likely cut you a bit of slack.</p><p>However, if you are able to get past your worries and deliver an impressive performance, the interviewer will appreciate your ability to perform under pressure, which is a quality always valued in teenage employees. To achieve that perfect interview, experts writing in the <a href=""https://jobs.telegraph.co.uk/article/job-interview-tips-for-teenagers/"">Telegraph</a> suggest completing a mock-up, either by visualizing the perfect interview experience in your own head or by acting it out with the help of family or friends.</p><p>Job openings for teens elicit more competition than ever before, which is why, come the big interview, you need to be on your A game. Prepare for a confident and professional appearance, and you'll increase your chances of landing that hot job.</p>"Interviews,Interview Tips for Teachers,"<h1>Interview Tips for Teachers</h1><p>Breaking into the world of teaching is no small feat. Not only you need a certificate/degree in education or a license to teach, but you also must pass several rounds of interviews with prospective schools. How do you survive this process? How do you demonstrate that you are the best teacher for the job during the interview? Keep these interview tips for teachers in mind.</p><h3><b>Research the School</b></h3><p>Aside from knowing the job description inside and out, you should research the goals of the school and the areas where it needs improvement. Visit the schools website and look at its prospectus and policies, and venture beyond the school site and research its various rankings. These will help you see what you can offer the school in terms of matching its own goals. Practices and policies change, so stay on top of the latest news and data. If you have a chance to visit the school beforehand, go, speak to the staff and students and get an idea of what kind of teacher the school is looking for. </p><h3><b>Market Yourself</b></h3><p>Think about how you want to sell yourself. In the world of retail sales, most people say, ""You should know your product."" When it comes to applying for a teaching job, your product is you, and you cannot sell yourself unless you are aware of your personal strengths and weaknesses. The <a href=""http://www.uni.edu/careerservices/students/special/education/docs/Interview-Tips-for-Educators.pdf"">University of Northern Iowa</a>says thatknowing your personal strengths and weaknesses are absolute requirements for the other steps you will need to market yourself as a classroom teacher.</p><h3><b>Be Careful about What You Say</b></h3><p>Your interviewer will be expecting you to demonstrate a number of qualities. Try to tailor your responses and contributions to reflect the following qualities:</p><p></p><ul><li>Positive social skills with co-workers and students, with the ability to motivate<br></li><li>Good communication skills, including the ability to listen effectively and provide smart answers<br></li><li>Excellent classroom management skills<br></li><li>Deep understanding and knowledge of the subject<br></li><li>A personal philosophy about teaching and education, as well as a passion to teach the subject(s)</li></ul><div>Some basic interview tips:<br><br></div><div>Always be positive when answering questions. Avoid saying, ""I dont know"" or ""Um"" or ""That is actually one of my weaknesses."" Be honest with your answers, but don't suggest that you are not a successful, confident and competent teacher. If you are confused about a question, try to ask the interviewer to restate it in a different way, or give the best answer you can based on your prior knowledge or teaching experiences. </div><h3>The Big Question</h3><div>One of the most common questionsduring an interview for a teaching jobis, ""Why do you want to be a teacher?"" Your answer to this question should be original and sincere. Provide a brief statement about your teaching philosophy. For example, you can say something like, ""I believe all children can learn best when taught with subject matter suitable to their level and interests by a teacher who cares, is patient and helps to increase confidence."" Don't say you decided to be a teacher just because the holidays are long and the hours are short, even though you're only kidding. A good answer also should describe your past teaching experiences and how rewarding you found them.<br></div><h3><b>Prepare Your Portfolio</b></h3><p>A <a href=""http://www.crlt.umich.edu/sites/default/files/resource_files/CRLT_no11.pdf"">teaching portfolio</a> is a compilation of documents that provides a record of how you have assessed and improved your teaching skills, your effectiveness as a teacher, the strategies you use, the subjects you teach or are ready to teach and the objectives and ideas that inform your teaching.</p><p>The <a href=""http://teachingcenter.wustl.edu/About/ProgramsforGraduateStudentsandPostdocs/resources/Pages/Creating-a-Teaching-Portfolio.aspx"">University of Washington in St. Louis</a> suggests that the secret to making an effective portfolio is to have a specific audience in mind when shaping both content and format. Carefully choose and organize materials so they will be helpful to readers, who as members of the interview panel are often flooded with application materials from applicants.</p><p>Each component of your portfolio should have a specific purpose. The evidence and examples you include should reflect the methods and strategies you mention in your Teaching Philosophy Statement. To improve your teaching portfolio, show it to professional teachers and peers whose opinions are trustworthy.</p><p>The interview is a crucial part of the application process, and these interview tips can help you succeed. Highlight your ambitions, strengths, achievements and, most importantly, your skills.</p>"Interviews,Interview Tips for Engineers,"<h1><b>Interview Tips for Engineers</b></h1><p></p><div><p>According to <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/articles/2013/03/14/engineering-grads-enjoy-greater-job-prospects"">U.S. News and World Report</a>, engineering majors have better job prospects than the rest of their collegiate counterparts. In fact, the <a href=""http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/c2/c2s2.htm"">National Science Foundation</a> reported that while the unemployment rate for college graduates with non-engineering degrees was almost 4 percent, engineering graduates had a 2 percent unemployment rate. But that doesn't mean businesses are just throwing jobs at engineers. Competition can be stiff. We encourage engineers to follow these tips in order to secure the best jobs available.</p><h3><strong>First Impressions</strong></h3><p>All of the usual rules of good interview etiquette apply--be on time, look nice, speak confidently, etc. On top of those, the interviewer will expect you to be knowledgeable about current events in the engineering world, so be sure to brush up prior to the interview.Although you may have passed engineering courses with high marks, there are portions of your studies you might have forgotten, so it's important to review key points, especially as they apply to the interviewer's business, in order to be better prepared for questions from the interviewer.</p><h3>The Interview</h3><p>Check the company's background before the interview. Visit their website and read about their work in trade publications.You should be able to speak to them about their competitors, market, how they have developed or grown over the years and what their future projects and plans are. Knowing these things will indicateto theinterviewer that you have a genuine interest in the company.</p><p>Questions in an engineering interview are often more technical than for other careers, so try to anticipate what questions may be asked. Civil engineers may be questioned about various structures, while mechanical engineers might be asked about specific engines. By being prepared for specific questions, you are less likely to be caught off-guard by something asked during the interviews.</p><p>Moreover, your responses shouldn't sound rehearsed. It's important to provide tangible examples to support what you are saying. Most companies today use the<a href=""http://www.stuaffrs.wayne.edu/resources/behavioralinterviewinfo.pdf"">STAR interview technique </a>when interviewing for any role. Talk about the situation you've been asked about, the task, what actions you've taken and what the end result or outcome was.</p><h3><strong>Possible Engineering Interview Questions</strong></h3><p>Questions asked during engineering interviews are designed to assess technical knowledge and communication ability. It's a good idea to prepare for <a href=""http://career-advice.monster.com/job-interview/interview-questions/engineering-interview-questions/article.aspx"">commonly asked questions</a> at these types of interviews, which may include:</p><ul><li>What is the most challenging project you have been involved with in the past year?</li><li>Describe an experience with a difficult client and how you handled the situation.</li><li>Explain the checks and balances you use to avoid making errors.</li><li>What engineering skills have you developed or improved upon over the past year?</li><li>How do you stay up-to-date on the latest technology?</li></ul><p>Although these are only a few of the questions commonly asked during engineering interviews, preparing ahead of time for how you will answer could make you stand out.</p><h3>Bring Samples of Your Best Work</h3><div>Depending on your specialization, all engineers should have something to bring to an interview to ""wow"" the interviewers. It could either be a product you have developed or something you have worked on or achieved. If the interviewer is an Engineering manager or Engineering Lead, you may use a whiteboard or prepare aPowerPoint<a href=""https://jobs.telegraph.co.uk/article/job-interview-tips-how-to-deliver-presentations/"">presentation</a>.</div><div><br></div><p>Of course, following up after an interview is still a nice touch.

The rhythm of hotel work is characterized by long periods of boredom punctuated by intense periods of furious activity. Rooms must meet exacting specifications because guests are tired and impatient from travel. Dealing with the demands of irritated travelers builds great reserves of patience and equanimity. Operating a hotel successfully has been compared to performing Shakespeare while serving the lunch rush at a diner.</p> <h3><b>Types of Jobs </b></h3> <p>Jobs vary by the different types of accommodations, such as low-cost motels, traditional hotels, vacation resorts, conference centers and long-term business suites. The <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Management/Lodging-managers.htm"">Occupational Outlook Handbook</a> points out that the median pay for a lodging manager is <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Management/Lodging-managers.htm"">over $46,000 per year,</a> which is excellent when you consider that the job requires a high school diploma and hotel experience.</p> <p>Job categories you will typically find at hotels include:</p> <p></p><ul><li><b>Front desk: </b>They are the faces of the hotel who greet new arrivals, communicate guest needs and take care of check-out. This is an entry level job with no educational requirements and plenty of upward mobility<br></li><li><b>Housekeeping:</b>The real heart of the hotel is all those who keep the rooms clean and organized. There is a great deal of hard work for little pay, but the tips can be substantial. This is also entry level and can lead to a position in housekeeping management.<br></li><li><b>Security:</b>Hotels are full of unknowns, so the security staff has to be vigilant and dedicated in protecting the guests and their belongings. These are entry level jobs, but many are part-time or outsourced.<br></li><li><b>Maintenance and landscaping:</b>Like a theater, a hotel has many machines that must operate at top efficiency plus outdoor areas that visually present the hotel's reputation. The maintenance workers and groundskeepers are entry level and are frequently required to be on-call.<br></li><li><b>Hotel management:</b>They do everything vital to keeping the business running smoothly. There is a strong need for marketing and promotions managers as well as group sales, HR, administrative support and financial operations managers. As for the top job, hotel general managers normally bring in around $95,000, but the salary can vary widely based on location and hotel size.<br></li></ul><p></p> <p>With the exception of motels, hotels and resorts normally have a restaurant, which means job categories also include:</p> <p></p><ul><li>Wait staff<br></li><li>Bartenders<br></li><li>Restaurant management<br></li><li>Kitchen staff<br></li><li>Professional chefs<br></li></ul><p></p> <p>Upscale resorts and spas in vacation areas hire a wide variety of specialists catering to tourists, such as boutique managers, recreation and fitness instructors, business center directors and concierge staff.</p> <h3><b>Benefits</b></h3> <p>Hotel jobs are not for everyone. These jobs often require long hours, late nights, hard work and low pay. As a result, there is a great deal of turnover, and the employees tend to be younger. The benefit is that experience is rewarded. Those who stick with the job normally see rapid promotion, significant pay raises and free hotel stays, including spa services across the country or throughout the world. Another perk of hotel jobs is meeting some fascinating people, such as CEOs and celebrities, in a casual atmosphere. The middle-of-the-night room service calls from politicians are the stuff of legend.</p> <h3><b>How to Find a Hotel Job</b></h3> <p> </p><p>Learn more about the hotel culture before you get too committed. <a href=""http://www.budgettravel.com/feature/0612_How_Confessions,4832/"">Confessions of a Front Desk Clerk</a> is a good place to start. When you are ready to get down to the nitty gritty details, the best way to get acquainted with hotel and hospitality job titles, responsibilities, typical salaries and job requirements is to search using the keyword ""hotel"" on <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/k-hotel-jobs.html"">Simply Hired</a>. From there, you can filter the results by job type, years of experience required or company name. A new filter lets you narrow the results by special categories, such as socially responsible companies, new-graduate-friendly or ""Fortune magazine's best companies to work for"" filters.</p> <h3><b>The Future of Hotel Jobs</b></h3> <p>The hotel of the future will blur the lines between <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/18/news/la-trb-marriott-hotels-future-travel-20130617"">vacation resort and mobile office</a>. That means that there will be considerable new growth with job titles that don't even exist yet. ""Total travel and tourism spend in the US, both domestic and outbound, is predicted to double from $830 billion to a staggering $1.6 trillion by 2015,"" reported <a href=""http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2006/06/05/hospitality_2010_four_mega.html"">Alex Kyriakidis</a>, Global Head of Tourism, Hospitality and Leisure at Deloitte. There is plenty of room for strong growth, especially at the luxury end of the market. As the <a href=""http://www.thematuremarket.com/SeniorStrategic/aging_population_travel_market-7261-5.html"">US population ages</a>, there will be a greater demand for the comfort and service of hotels over low-priced motels or sharing economy alternatives such as<a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/"">AirBnB</a>.It is not job security or perks that are most important for many in the hospitality industry. They do so for the lifestyle or commitment to their work family.</p>"Career,Employment Opportunities for People with Disabilities,"<h1>Employment Opportunities for People with Disabilities</h1><p>People with disabilities get jobs every day. These resilient individuals don't let perceptions hold them back. They create great resumes, and they ace interviews. If you have disabilities and are looking for work, here are some tips on finding employment.</p><h3>Initiatives Changing the Disability Employment Landscape</h3><p>To assist the disabled, the U.S. Department of Labor created a <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/odep/topics/CampaignForDisabilityEmployment.htm"">Campaign for Disability Employment</a>.

These are opportunities for people with disabilities to obtain employment withoutcostly accommodations.

It can be tempting to treat it as a casual event, but if you want to get serious about getting a job, you should prepare ahead of time. These tips for job fairs can help you stand out in a crowd.<br></p> <h3>Research the Companies That Will Be There<br></h3> <p>You only have a limited amount of time to talk to the employers at the fair, so make that time count. <a href=""http://www.career.vt.edu/JobSearchGuide/JobCareerFairPrep.html"">Virginia Tech</a> recommends that you find out which companies will be at the fair, then make two lists. One should include the companies you definitely want to consider, and the second list should feature the ones you will check out if you have enough time. <br></p> <p>Once you have an idea of which employers you want to meet, do some basic research on each one. You should at least visit each company's website to get a feel for the industry, the jobs available and the requirements for each position. As you do this research, you might find that certain companies no longer appeal to you, in which case you can avoid wasting your time meeting with them. The employers you do meet with will be impressed with your knowledge of the company.  <br></p> <h3>Be Prepared with Both Questions and Answers <br></h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/03/28/10-steps-for-flourishing-at-a-job-fair"">U.S. News & World Report</a>, you should be prepared to introduce yourself to employers. This is not the time to wing it. Prepare answers to common questions. For example, when company representatives ask you to tell them about yourself, you should clearly explain how your strengths and experiences make you qualified for the kind of job for which you are looking. Your goal is to immediately stand out to employers as a strong candidate for the job, which leaves no margin for tediousness when it comes to your introduction. <br></p> <p>Once you have good answers ready, prepare some good questions, too. <a href=""http://www.careers.umd.edu/page.cfm?page_id=114"">The University of Maryland</a> advises job seekers to ask which positions the employer is hiring for and what kind of training and experience are required in the ideal candidate. You can also ask if the employer has any tips for success in that industry.<br></p> <h3>Bring the Proper Documents <br></h3> <p>Just as you would with an interview, you should make sure to bring a few essential documents if you want to look and feel prepared at a job fair. The <a href=""http://career.ucla.edu/Students/CareerFairs/CareerFairPreparation/RulesToFollow.aspx"">UCLA Career Center</a> recommends that you bring several copies of your resume. You should also bring business cards, if possible. Though you will likely have to fill out a job application to be officially considered, resumes and business cards at least help company representatives remember who you are once they leave the job fair. <br></p> <p>You should also bring a notepad and pen so you can take some notes. This is especially important if you talk to several employers, since you will need a way to remember your impressions of each one. Be sure to put your documents and notepad into a briefcase or small folder if you want to look professional and organized. <br></p> <h3>Dress to Impress <br></h3> <p>Job fairs might not be considered as formal as interviews, but you still need to make a good first impression. In fact, you never know when you will be asked for an interview on the spot! For this reason, you should wear professional, conservative clothing, just as you would if you were going to meet with an interviewer at the office. The only difference is that it is important to wear comfortable shoes, such as closed-toed flats for women, since you could be walking around and standing for hours.</p>"Resumes,Online Job Applications: Everything You Need to Know,"<h2>Online Job Applications: Everything You Need to Know</h2> <p>Online job postings draw hundreds, sometimes thousands, of applicants. Consequently, an online job application must stand out to make it to the top of the pile. This can be a real challenge when online job applications force every respondent to provide the same information. Each submission, therefore, must be flawless to stand a chance. Below are some helpful tips to help your application get to and stay at the top of the pile.</p> <p></p> <h3><strong>Tip 1: Read the Listing and Tailor Your Response</strong></h3> <p></p> <p>As noted on <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/07/11/the-9-best-tips-for-submitting-an-online-job-application""><u>US News and World Report</u></a>, job applicants have an annoying habit of applying for jobs that do not fit their qualifications. Before choosing to apply, take the time to thoroughly investigate what the position entails. If you do not have the skills, it may not be the right position for you. If you do have the requested experience, take some extra time to edit your responses to highlight what the employer wants in an applicant. Many companies now use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to automatically sort out applications that are missing keyword phrases. Avoid getting caught in the auto-sort by ensuring your response matches the job posting and desired qualifications.</p> <p></p> <h3><strong>Tip 2: Prepare for Digital Data Overload</strong></h3> <p></p> <p>The <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/lwd/employment-services/job-seekers-services/job-hunting-information/tips-for-completing-online-employment-applications.html""><u>Massachusetts State Government</u></a> recommends that online job seekers pay careful attention to all information listed on an application. Using the wrong address can delay the results of a background check, and a small inconsistency can cause major delays in the hiring process. Additionally, many employers now check social media sites before scheduling an interview. The wrong post on Facebook or inappropriate tweets could take you out of the running. Make sure your online presence is as professional as your resume.</p> <p></p> <h3><strong>Tip 3: Fill Out Forms Completely</strong></h3> <p></p> <p>Not only do auto-sort functions discard incomplete applications, a blank field represents a missed opportunity, according to <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/07/11/the-9-best-tips-for-submitting-an-online-job-application""><u>US News and World Report</u></a>. The more information you provide to a prospective employer, the more able they are to make a hiring decision. If they are asking about a skill you do not have, express willingness to obtain it. If they ask about education, mention any classes that may have relevance. A fully filled-out application shows your enthusiasm to your potential employer.</p> <p></p> <h3><strong>Tip 4: Track Your Responses</strong></h3> <p></p> <p>Applying online allows you to submit many applications in a single day, but it is important to maintain records of where you send them. Not only is it required for unemployment compensation, but it will also help you when applying for multiple openings at the same company. Many employers maintain applicant profiles that always stay the same. Duplicate profiles may cause confusion during the interview process. If applying for different positions, tailor your resume and cover letter to ensure that your profile is complete and consistent.</p> <p></p> <h3><strong>Tip 5: Make Responses 100% Error Free</strong></h3> <p></p> <p>Online means eternal. Nothing posted online is ever completely lost or forgotten. The <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/lwd/employment-services/job-seekers-services/job-hunting-information/tips-for-completing-online-employment-applications.html""><u>Massachusetts State Government </u></a>recommends that you thoroughly proofread your application before submitting it. A spelling or grammar error can come back to bite you. Double check all of your content to be sure that everything is spelled correctly and would pass the most stringent grammar checks. After all, it would be a shame to miss out on an opportunity today because of a mistake made on an application to the company more than five years ago.</p> <p></p> <p>Even with a flawless application, it will probably take many more online job applications to score an interview. Be prepared to submit dozens of resumes before getting a call for an interview. Of course, with the streamlined submission process, submitting dozens of resumes can be done in just a few days, rather than the weeks it takes to make personal contacts. <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Online job applications</a> offer more options and opportunities than virtually any other method.</p> <p></p>"Job Search Tips,What to Do Once You Receive a Job Offer,"<p></p><h1>What to Do Once You Receive a Job Offer</h1><p>It can be tempting to jump and down and accept a job offer the second you get it, but this is not always the wisest choice, and you could end up regretting your quick decision later. Before you make a final decision on whether to accept the job you have been offered, take note of these tips. <br></p> <h3>Get the Offer in Writing <br></h3> <p>If you get a phone call with the news, ask if you can get the offer in writing, even if it is just a short email. According to <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2010/07/19/5-things-to-do-when-you-get-a-job-offer"">U.S. News & World Report</a>, this can give you some recourse if you later find that the offer is not as good as you originally thought. For example, you might find that the salary and benefits are lower than you were told or that your job duties will be different from what you thought. Even if all the details are not yet worked out, you should at least ask for a written copy of the job description, title and estimated salary. <br></p> <h3>Request Time to Think It Over <br></h3> <p>Most employers should realize you need some time to make your decision, so be wary if the company demands an answer the same day. If a deadline for your decision is not given, you should ask by what date you have to have an answer. After all, you will need some time to not only think about your options, but also compare the offer with any others you have received. This could take anywhere from a few days to a week on average, which is why most companies offer a week to get a decision. <br></p> <h3>Ask Any Questions You Have <br></h3> <p>Surely you have some lingering questions about the company and position that you never got a chance to ask during the interview process. Now is the time to ask those questions. <a href=""http://work.chron.com/after-job-offer-11414.html"">The Houston Chronicle</a> suggests you start by finding out to whom you will be reporting, then attempt to get more in-depth answers to any questions that were only briefly addressed during interviews. You need to make sure you have all the facts down before you make a decision. <br></p> <h3>Do Your Own Research <br></h3> <p>There are some questions you might not get a clear answer to when you talk to the hiring manager. You can use your research skills to find out what you need to know. For example, you can check online reviews that were written by past and current employees to get a feel for the good and bad that comes with the company. If you know anyone who works for the company or has in the past, consider asking what they like and dislike about it. <br></p> <h3>Negotiate</h3> <p>The final step in the process is perhaps the most important one, since it involves your salary and benefits. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2012/10/17/the-questions-you-must-ask-yourself-before-accepting-a-job-offer/"">Forbes</a> recommends that you first find out if the salary you have been offered is negotiable. Then think about whether it is competitive for your field and what you believe you deserve for the work you will be doing. <br></p> <p>Be sure to also ask about the benefits, including health insurance, paid time off, 401(k) matching, tuition reimbursement and any other perks you have been promised, then find out when you are eligible for them. If the answers sound acceptable to you at least after a little negotiating you should feel ready to formally accept the job offer!</p>"Career,The Advantages of Resume Software,"<h1>The Advantages of Resume Software</h1><p>If you're writing your resume without the help of resume software, you might be doing it the hard way.

If so, it's time to take another look at your resume. You may have the right qualifications for the the job, but if your resume is poorly written, hiring managers won't give it a second look. Take a look at the following bad resume example, followed by explanations of what's wrong with it, to see if you are making mistakes on your resume.</p><h3><b>The Bad Resume</b></h3><div><b>John Doe</b></div><p>johnlikestoparty@email.com</p><div><u><b>Objective</b></u></div><p>I want to be sucessful and move up in my career to make a lot of money.</p><div><b><u>Experience</u></b></div><div>Salesperson</div><div>TV Depot</div><p>Los Angeles, California</p><div><ul><li>Hired and managed employees</li><li>Managed inventory</li><li>Customer service</li></ul><div><b><u>Education</u></b></div></div><div>USC</div><div>Class of 2004</div><div>Los Angeles, CA</div><div>Bachelor Degree</div><p>GPA 2.0</p><div>Uni High</div><div>Class of 1999</div><p>High school Diploma</p><div><u><b>Hobbies</b></u></div><p>Skiing, swimming, archery, traveling</p><p><b>References Available Upon Request</b></p><h2>Why This is a Bad Resume</h2><p>Here is a breakdown of what is wrong with the above resume:</p><h3><b>Resume Header</b></h3><p>The header of this resume does not contain an address or phone number. In addition, the email address is inappropriate. If you don't have a professional sounding email address, such as JohnDoe@hotmail.com, make one immediately.</p><h3><b>Objective</b></h3><p>There are two problems with this section. First, ""successful"" is misspelled. Typos are never acceptable in a resume as it shows a lack of attention to detail. Second, this objective is generic, shallow and doesn't tell the hiring manager what you have to offer to the company. Here is an example of a well-written objective:</p><div><ul><li>To use my experience as a sales manager and knowledge gained through my bachelor's degree in marketing to earn a marketing job from a major electronics development company.<br></li></ul><h3><b>Experience</b></h3></div><p>This section shouldn't just simply list your responsibilities at a job. It should highlight your achievements to show that you are a capable employee. For example, instead of saying you ""hired and managed employees,"" you could say ""I managed a team of 10 salespeople who exceeded sales goals for the past 12 months.""</p><h3><b>Education</b></h3><div>There are several problems with this section, which include:</div><div><ul><li>The university name should be written out, not abbreviated (Example: University of Southern California instead of USC)</li><li>Don't list your GPA if it wasn't too impressive; only list your GPA if it was a 3.5 or above, and only then if you were a recent grad or it is common in your field to do so</li><li><a href=""http://www.rasmussen.edu/student-life/blogs/career-services/27-common-resume-mistakes/"">Don't list your high school</a>, unless that's your highest level of education</li></ul><h3><b>Hobbies</b></h3></div><p>There was a time when it was recommended to put a hobby section in a resume, but this is no longer the case. <a href=""http://www.ndsu.edu/career/news/detail/5654/"">Leave this section out</a> as it is not necessary and is viewed by hiring managers as irrelevant.</p><h3><b>References</b></h3><p>It is not necessary to write ""references available upon request."" The hiring managers know they can ask for references. You are just wasting space by telling them that they can.</p><p>Take a good look at the above bad resume example and at your resume. Make sure your resume doesn't have any of these mistakes. In addition to fixing your mistakes, take the time to consider if your resume is the best it can be. Remember, your resume is your ticket to a call for an interview, so it's worth spending the extra time to perfect it.</p>"Resumes,How Much Education Should I Include on My Resume?,"<h1><b>How Much Education Should I Include on My Resume?</b></h1><p>There was a time when the education section of your resume was a no-brainer. If you had a bachelor's degree, you listed it. If you had a master's degree, you listed it. If you had a doctorate, why were you filling out job applications? Today's resume is a far more complex matter.</p><p>Community colleges, private employee learning centers, adult education classes at major universities, online courses and international degrees add up to a confusing tangle of para-education for employers to sort through. You don't want to be eliminated on a technicality, such as ""too much education,"" so it is important to pay close attention to this area. We've put together the latest advice from <a href=""http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jlarsen/rex2/education.html"">career advisers at universities</a> and <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/06/20/10-things-to-leave-off-your-resume"">hiring managers</a> at <a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/Why-I-Tossed-Your-R-sum-/131576/"">major corporations</a> to help you customize and perfect the education section of your resume for each prospective employer.</p> <h3>Lead with Experience</h3> <p>Your education section should follow the professional experience section unless you don't have any relevant experience for the specific position you want. As you can see, you will need more than one customized resume, and some job seekers modify each resume to highlight different areas of their background.</p> <h3>What the Education Section Should Include</h3> <p>List the most recent education first, then proceed in reverse chronological order. You can choose the order that best fits your format, but the descriptions should include the full name of the university (no abbreviations or initials), type of the degree, field of study and date of graduation. If you are still enrolled, list an expected graduation date. Finally, you must include the city and state. GPA is not necessary or customary unless it is remarkable or expected in your field.</p> <h3> <p>What it Normally Does Not Include</p></h3> <p>Continuing education and professional coursework normally should not be included here but can be addressed in the cover letter. However, three exceptions to this rule are those cases where 1) your education is light; 2) the qualifications mention a degree you don't have; 3) your degrees do not address the demands of the new position. For example, if your degree was in English and the job is in management, any statistics, coaching or accounting coursework would be very important for the hiring manager.</p> <p>Community college has become a feeder for larger universities with strict admissions guidelines. Employers are well aware of that, so it is not necessary to list the community college where you spent the first two years of your degree. However, it is sometimes to your benefit to do so. Community colleges afford better professor/student ratios that make it easier to get great references with connections in the industry where you want to work. If your reference will be from your community college, include it, and make it one of your strengths in the cover letter.</p><h3><b>The Very Large Business Card</b></h3><p>Consider your resume to be an extended business card. It is merely a placeholder designed to let the hiring team know in general terms how close your experience fits the needs of the job. This is not a place to attempt to impress anyone with your education. The cover letter and your interview will provide plenty of time and space to discuss your proudest moments. Resumes are mainly used now to weed out candidates, so the more succinct and relevant you are, the better your chances of making it through to the next round.</p>"Job Search Tips,Where to Find Resume Help,"<h1><b>Where to Find Resume Help</b></h1> <p></p> <p>Writing a resume can be a challenge, even if you have years of experience in the workforce.

You have limited space to list your accomplishments and show an employer what makes you right for the job. However, with the right structure, youll be able to create a resume that will catch the eye of a hiring manager and help you land an interview. The best place to start is by creating a resume outline.The basics of a resume are simple. Here's what needs to be included:</p><h3>Contact Information</h3><p>The placement of your contact information is very important, particularly since many firms use screening software to rank resumes. Your name should be the firstitem you place on your resume. Next, you will need to enter your physical address as well as your phone number. It's also a good idea to include your email address, but make sure it is a professional sounding email address. For example, you don't want the email address you created as a teenager going on your resume. If you have a website, you can also add it, but this is optional. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Objective or Summary of Qualifications</b></h3> <p></p> <p>This section is designed to state the type of job in which you are interested.

You also can use this section to <a href=""http://www.uwb.edu/careers/job-search-tools/resumes/functional-outline"">summarize the qualifications</a> that make you an attractive candidate for the position. Always customize this section for the specific job for which you are applying.</p> <p></p> <h3><b>Skills</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>This section should be used to go into a little detail about your skills. Dont list everyday skills. Focus on specific skill sets that match what the position calls for. A bullet list or even a graphic is an attractive way to highlight your skills. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Education</b></h3> <p></p> <p>If you do not have a college degree, this can be a tricky area. If relevant, include certifications or continuing education courses that you have attended. Otherwise, list the college or university you attended, the dates you were there and your major. If your GPA was over 3.5 and you are still a student or are entering the workforce, you can also include that information. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Experience</b></h3> <p></p> <p>The experience section is a history of your past employment. Most hiring managers prefer to see this in <a href=""http://www.washington.edu/admin/hr/roles/ee/careerdev/jobsearch-tools/resumebasics.html"">reverse chronological order</a>, with your most recent employer first. Include your job title, the name of the company, the dates you worked and a brief description of your duties in that position. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Other Things to Include</b></h3> <p></p> <p>If you have space left on your resume, it is a good idea to go into brief detail on any extra experience you may have. For example, including volunteer work you have done will help show another side of your personality. You can also include any affiliations you have with professional organizations or current classes you are taking that enhance your skill sets. Put yourself in the mindset of a hiring manager and include information they would like to see. </p><p>This resume outline will help you structure your next resume.

This might be true, as both inferior and superior job candidates dont stay up-to-date on resume-writing strategies the way professional resume writers do.</p><p>The primary advantage of hiring a resume writer is that youre hiring someone who is more knowledgeable about self-marketing than you are. Contrary to what Nemko claims, a resume is not comparable to a college application; it's comparable to an advertisement. Its perfectly ethical to hire someone to create an advertisement for you. Its the employers responsibility to properly vet candidates, and many of them do, which is why many resume writers are committed to presenting an honest but appealing story of their client to potential employers.</p><h3>The Professional Resume</h3><p>A resume is a marketing document. You are marketing your ability to do a job whenever you submit a resume to a potential employer. The job of the resume is to communicate your abilities, experiences and training in such a way that you interest the potential employer enough to contact you for an interview. A well-written resume cant do anything more than that. A well-written resume wont get you a job. It will simply help you present yourself as a viable candidate.<br></p><p>Like advertisements, resume styles and requirements are subject to change. For example, objectives are considered outdated by some. Contemporary resumes often begin with something thats more like a sales pitch than a classic objective. In the past, resumes focused on past job duties; now they focus on former job accomplishments. Contemporary resumes have to make it through a gauntlet of computer programs, recruiters and HR professionals before they ever reach the manager who needs your services.</p><p>The professional resume writers job is to keep up with all these changes and to produce a current resume that gets results. A resume writer will also pull relevant information from you in order to communicate your story effectively. A professionally written resume will communicate your experience, accomplishments, training and abilities. Its your responsibility to submit your resume for jobs that youre actually qualified to do. </p><h3>Getting the Services You Need</h3><p>Unfortunately, there are some resume-writing services that just arent up to snuff. <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2010/12/07/tips-for-hiring-a-professional-resume-writer"">Andrew Rosen</a> of U.S. News providedthese tips for hiring the right professional resume writer to help in your job search:</p><ul><li>Think about what you want from your resume before you speak with a resume writer.

It comes with perks such as outstanding pay, state-of-the-art facilities and, as <a href=""http://computer.howstuffworks.com/googleplex3.htm"">HowStuffWorks</a> pointed out, free haircuts, onsite video games and even dry cleaning services. In order to receive the star treatment, though, prospective employees must prove themselves with a combination of impeccable references, academic successes and relevant work experience.</p><p>In past years, though, these requirements took a backseat to a rigorous interview process that grilled employees on everything from grade point average to, believe it or not, brainteasers. The company has since abandoned many of these tests, although plenty of stringent requirements remain.</p><p>Most job interviews are not as difficult as what Google did. We share these questions as a reminder to always be fully prepared for anything when you enter a job interview.</p><h3><strong>Brainteasers</strong></h3><p>Many a prospective Google employee was delighted to learn that brainteasers were axed from the employer's list of required interview processes. In a scathing <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?_r=0"">New York Times interview</a>, Google Senior Vice President of People Operations, Laszlo Bock, succinctly referred to the infamous brainteaserrequirement as a complete ""waste of time,"" only serving to ""make the interviewer feel smart.""</p><p>According to <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/15-google-interview-questions-that-used-to-make-geniuses-feel-dumb-2012-11#how-many-golf-balls-can-fit-in-a-school-bus-1"">Business Insider</a>, old brainteasers included questions surrounding the number of golf balls one could fit in a school bus,the exact number of times any given clock's hands overlap and even the following old joke: A man pushed a car all the way to the hotel, where he promptly went broke -- what happened? Surely,swathes of rejected applicants who struggled during the brainteaser portions of their interviews agreed with this frank assessment. </p><p>The answer to the car joke: He was playing Monopoly.</p><h3><strong>Hypothetical Behavior Questions</strong></h3><p>Bock hates brainteasers, but he is a fan of behavior-related questions in job interviews. He says he does not agree with the typical employer practice of presenting applicants with hypothetical situations, then having them provide their best course of action. This was a former tactic utilized by Google that has since been abandoned.Now, Bock recommends asking interviewees to offer examples of past situations in which they have used skills deemed necessary for the position in question.</p><h3><strong>Grade Point Averages</strong></h3><p>The company has ceased asking applicants for detailed information regarding their grade point averages because, with the possible exception of very recent graduates, this information simply offers no bearing on how well the interviewee stands to do in a paid position. Instead, the focus is now on references from the prospective employee's time at school (if that employee has recently graduated) and a much greater emphasis on work experience and references related to that work experience.</p><h3><strong>Test Scores</strong></h3><p>As with grade point averages, Google was forced to let scores on such standardized tests as the GMAT go by the wayside. Like GPAs, they had little success in predicting a given employee's performance upon obtaining employment at Google. Interviewers can learn far more about a job candidate's knowledge by simply asking questions related to the area of employment. An interviewee able to insert knowledge and expertise into his or her answers is more likely to understand the field than someone who managed to obtain a decent test score several years ago.</p><p>Google interview questions remain challenging, but gone are the pointless hoops through which past applicants were forced to jump. Today's prospective employees--for any job at at any company--should be prepared to show their current expertise with thorough descriptions of their knowledge and how it applies to the field in which they hope to work.</p>"Interviews,Inspirational Quotes that Work as Job Interview Tips,"<h1>Inspirational Quotes that Work as Job Interview Tips</h1><p>Do you dread the thought of going on your next job interview?

We all know how stressful the interview process can be, but practicing ahead of time can give you confidence and make the interview experience a smooth one. The more you work on your interviewing skills, the more likely you are to appear ready in the eyes of a hiring manager, and that confidence could be the edge that gets you the job.</p> <p></p> <p>There are several ways you can practice for an upcoming interview. Lets take a look at a few of the best techniques. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Go Through Common Interview Questions</b></h3> <p></p> <p>One of the best ways to prepare for a job interview is to review a list of <a href=""http://www.western.edu/academics/career-services/interview-preparation.html"">common interview questions</a> and come up with good answers. Get a few sheets of paper and actually write down your responses. This will help you commit what you are saying to memory and will give you a chance to really think about how you want to answer those questions. </p> <p></p> <p>Reviewing questions ahead of time will minimize the chances you will be caught off-guard by a question. While each interviewer is going to have a different style and might ask different questions, running through sample questions will put you in the rhythm of selling yourself correctly.</p> <p></p> <p>Its also a not a bad idea to come up with a few questions of your own. Do a little background research on the company and put your list together. Interviewers typically ask if you have any questions, and it is a good idea to be prepared with a few of them when this question comes up. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Try a Mock Interview</b></h3> <p></p> <p>Ask a friend to sit down with you and conduct a mock interview. This is a good way to practice and build your confidence. Print out a list of commonly asked interview questions, and ask your friend to ask each one. Set the stage properly for this mock interview. If you have a home office with a desk, you can set up a similar environment to the one youll be in during the interview. Dress for the part as well. This exercise is great for calming nerves. Once you walk into the real interview, you will feel a lot more comfortable since you have already gone through something similar. Mock interviews are a way to train your brain to get over nerves. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>An Exercise to Try</b></h3> <p></p> <p>Another way to improve your confidence and prepare for the interview is to take a sheet of paper and<a href=""http://www.careeronestop.org/ResumesInterviews/Interviews/GetReady.aspx"">write down all of the skills</a> that are mentioned in the job listings description on one side. On the other side of the paper write down all of the skills you have that match that position. This shows you whether or not you are a qualified candidate, and it can also help you sell yourself during the interview. Use this trick to tailor your experience for each employerbefore you send in your resume.</p> <p></p> <p>Before your next job interview, give a few of these practice techniques a try. You might be surprised at how prepared you will feel, and you may notice that your nerves have been replaced by feelings of confidence.</p>"Job Search Tips,Second Interview Questions,"<p></p><div><h1>Second Interview Questions</h1><p>If you have been called to go in for a second job interview, that means you caught the employer's attention as a good fit for the job. It's no time to relax, though, since you can expect to be asked a new round of second interview questions. These tend to be more specific than the questions asked in the first interview. Before you answer, it is important that think about why you are being asked each question. This can help you formulate the answer the interviewer is looking for from the ideal candidate. </p></div> <h3>Tell Me About Yourself</h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.jonathanmilligan.com/6-common-2nd-interview-questions/"">Jonathan Milligan's</a> blog, you should expect to be asked this question at a second interview, even if you were already asked it at the first one. This is because you will likely be meeting with someone different this time. As always, employers are hoping to hear about the qualities for which they are looking in an ideal candidate, not random facts that have no bearing on the job. <br></p><h3>Why Do You Want This Position? </h3>The<a href=""http://www.careereducation.columbia.edu/resources/tipsheets/finding-a-job-second-interview"">Columbia University Center for Career Education</a>says that interviewers want to make sure you still really want the job once you have learned what it entails. If it turns out you are not sure you want to work in the environment you have seen during your interviews, or if the job duties and schedule are simply not what you thought they would be, now is the time to be honest. If you are still interested in the position, be specific when you answer so that it is clear you have been paying attention to the details. You can point out the benefits you see in the position as well as any challenges that the interviewer has already discussed and why you are excited to take them on. <br> <h3>How Would You Handle This Situation? <br></h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://work.chron.com/secondround-interview-etiquette-8795.html"">The Houston Chronicle</a>, interviewers who ask how you would handle a particular problem at their company are looking for specific answers that would work well with their policies and procedures. This is why you should research the company and its policies as much as you can before answering this common second interview question. Employers also ask this question to see how well you work under pressure, as applicants can become flustered when they have to come up with a fast answer to a hypothetical question. <br></p> <h3>When Can You Start the Job?<br></h3> <p>While this question is a good sign, it doesn't necessarily mean you've got the job. It's still hypothetical at this point. The employer wants to make sure you are ready to get to work but not at the expense of your current employer. For this reason, Jonathan Milligan states that you should let the interviewer know that you need to give your employer two weeks' notice if you are currently employed. If you do not have a job right now, let the interviewer know you could start as soon as possible, since this displays your enthusiasm for the position. <br></p> <h3>Describe a Time When You Showed Your Leadership Skills <br></h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://work.chron.com/good-secondinterview-questions-7751.html"">The Houston Chronicle</a>, this is one of the most common second interview questions among some employers because they want to see examples of leadership. The first interview does not always allow enough time for candidates to answer questions that involve specific examples, but subsequent interviews are more likely to focus on questions that show hidden strengths, such as leadership.</p>"Job Search Tips,Second Interview Answers,"<p></p><div><div><h1>Second Interview Answers</h1><p></p></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><p></p><p>The point of the second interview is to really narrow down the candidates that the employer thinks are qualified to do the job. This means that your second interview answers will have to show that you can perform the job duties better than the other candidates and that you would also be a great fit with the employer. This is why many of the questions are focused on both your skills and your personality. If you want to feel as prepared as possible for your second interview, you should consider the questions you will likely be asked, and think of answers that will increase your chances of getting the job.</p> <h3><b>How Did You Benefit Your Previous Employer? </b></h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.theladders.com/career-advice/how-to-prepare-for-second-interview"">TheLadders</a>, the second interview is a great time to show how you improved some aspect of a job you had in the past. This means you should be prepared to describe how you improved sales, reduced expenses or proved otherwise beneficial to an employer. This shows the interviewer that they can expect you to be a great addition to their company as well. Be prepared to have specific details about your methods, such as the strategy you used and any tools you put to your advantage. Link your successes to the references you've provided so that the hiring manager can hear more later from a third party about your achievements.<br></p> <h3><b>Why Do You Want This Job?</b></h3> <p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2013/07/01/3-interview-questions-you-should-be-ready-to-answer/"">Forbes</a> recommends that you start by answering with what you like about this line of work, such as the chance to improve someone's day through great customer service. Then describe why you are passionate about the product or service you would be offering. Make sure you come off as honest and sincere. Even if it is not your dream job, you should take some time before the second interview to think about the top aspects you are most looking forward to in the position. Then focus on those instead of any drawbacks of the job.<br></p><h3><b>Describe a Time When You. </b></h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.everydayinterviewtips.com/questions-and-answers/second-interview"">Everyday Job Interview Tips</a>, you can expect to hear some situational questions during the second interview. The point of these questions is for the employer to judge both your confidence and ability to make decisions that you believe are correct. The questions may inquire about how you handled a problem in the workplace or possibly how you spoke up when you disagreed with your superior. When answering these kinds of questions, make sure you are both specific and honest, and always avoid speaking badly about your previous workplace. <br></p> <h3><b>Do You Have Any Questions for Us? </b></h3> <p>As you consider your best second interview answers, think of the questions you did not get to ask during the first interview. Avoid asking about facts you can find on the website. Also avoid asking about salary and benefits, unless you think they are a potential roadblock. Instead, ask questions only an interviewer would be able to answer, such as what the typical workweek is like or what it takes to advance in the company. If you cannot come up with any questions, <a href=""http://www.everydayinterviewtips.com/questions-and-answers/second-interview"">Everyday Job Interview Tips</a> advises that you at least ask about the general philosophy of the department.</p>"Resumes,Career Advice from 5 Successful Businesspeople,"<h1><b>Career Advice from 5 Successful Businesspeople</b></h1> <p></p> <p>When designing a career path, it sometimes helps to incorporate lessons and ideas of others.

You know you have the qualifications that your potential employer is looking for, and you got along with everyone during the interviews. There's still just a little more work to do. Send a thank you letter as soon as possible after the interview. You're looking for any edge, and you better believe your competition is writing a thank you letter, too.</p><div><h3>Your Audience</h3></div><div>Consider the recipient of your thank you note. They are professionals, so treat them as such. Keep your message formal and smart. Avoid cultural references or turns of phrases that are easily lost on a person who isn't your age or who didn't grow up where you did. Your tone should convey your best you, as if you were writing a thank you letter to the president. If you made notes during the interview--and you should have--refer back to something specific that came up during the interview to get the hiring manager thinking of you again in a positive light.</div><div><h3>The Medium</h3></div><div>Email is acceptable, although you should avoid it for high-end, highly-competitive positions. The art of writing a physical letter is often lost these days, making it a novelty that might catch a hiring manager's attention. It also shows that you're willing to go the extra mile to let the interviewer know you appreciate the opportunity they gave you. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2013/08/26/job-seekers-no-the-interview-thank-you-note-is-not-dead/"">Avoid calling</a>, as most hiring managers would prefer that you keep non-essential communication written. They are busy enough, especially if they're actively hiring employees. Do not send a text message to the hiring manager's phone. It shows that you want to take the easiest way out of things, which doesn't bode well for you.</div><div><h3>The Content</h3></div><p><a href=""http://lifehacker.com/5982951/write-a-post+interview-thank-you-that-actually-improves-your-chances-at-getting-the-job"">Keep it brief</a>.Reference the position for which you applied.

Preparing STAR interview answers is important in helping you organize your accomplishments and skills as well as ensuring that you answer with confidence.</p><p>Here's a quick overview of how the STAR method works:</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Situation:</b>Recall a job experience related to the question asked. This provides context for your story, giving the interviewer the who, what, when, where and why of the situation.<br></li><li><b>Task:</b>Outline the steps you took in order to resolve the situation. Doing so shows that you thought out your tasks before proceeding further. At this time, you also want to introduce any additional challenges you faced, such as a looming deadline.<br></li><li><b>Action:</b>Describe the actions you took to start and finish the tasks. Here's where you should really shine. Your actions in completing the task need to imply positive traits, such as taking the initiative or demonstrating your dedication. Try not to use buzzwords; instead, show the interviewer that you embody those traits.<br></li><li><b>Result:</b>How did you successfully resolve the situation and achieve a positive result? Whenever possible, follow it up with concrete data. As<a href=""http://careers.theguardian.com/careers-blog/star-technique-competency-based-interview"">Michael Higgins wrote at the Guardian</a>, ""Nameless figures and undefined successes can make the answer feel less convincing."" So rather than saying, ""The client was really happy with my solution,"" try to give details, such as, ""After that, Harry's Hardware became a repeat client and increased their advertising spending by 20 percent.""<br></li></ul><p></p><p>As<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-ace-the-interview-2012-5"">one recruiter mentioned on Business Insider</a>, the STAR technique can be summed up as having ""amultitude of stories ready that [you] can easily reference and share with the interviewer."" Weaving your experiences into a practiced story is important because your examples will be easier for you to remember, and it will also show that you're self-aware and have learned from those experiences.<br></p><h2>Getting Started</h2><div><p>In order to better illustrate a STAR interview answer, here's a sample story in response to the question, ""Have you ever had to manage an unhappy customer?""</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Situation:</b>Our client, Avalon Furniture, was very unhappy with what our marketing firm was producing for their boutique furniture website.

I noticed that the Facebook and Twitter updates were too long and not engaging and that the blog posts were too short and didn't say anything unique about their business.<br></li><li><b>Action:</b> I wrote up a whole new marketing plan to pitch to them, which included writing longer blog posts, creating a Facebook album of items in the store and creating a schedule for tweets that would go out every day.<br></li><li><b>Result:</b> After implementing the new plan for a month, they saw website traffic increase about 20 percent, and in-store sales increased by 45 percent.

The thought of job interviews can trigger tongue ties, sweaty palms, nausea, stuttering and many other nervous tics. Getting over nerves allows candidates to do their best, and public speaking tips offer comprehensive advice for clear communication in a nerve-wracking setting. Here are seven public speaking tips to help you talk clearly, confidently and without fear during job interviews.</p><p></p><h3><b>Learn from the Best</b></h3>Public speaking instills feelings of fear in most people, but that is largely because of unfamiliarity. Before putting yourself into a situation where you will need your public speaking skills, learn from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EqwxsOB1MM"">good speakers</a>. The first thing you will notice is that confidence engages audiences and helps build rapport. How do you learn to project the same confidence?<p></p><p></p><h3><b>Preparation</b></h3>There is no such thing as too much preparation. The amount of research that goes into a three-minute speech is a bit daunting, but the level of preparation ensures that you are confident about the subject matter. How does that apply to job interviews? Anticipated questions are easy to answer. As long as you have a good idea of what you are facing, you can take the time to create the best possible answers. Research the company and the position you want in order to be sure that you have a solid grasp of the material.<p></p><p></p><h3><b>Practice, Practice, Practice</b></h3>According to<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soren-petersen/the-art-of-public-speakin_b_3969331.html""> Toastmaster International</a>, a volunteer organization that specializes in personal growth, delivering a speech 10 times can give you a solid grasp of the skills needed to communicate with confidence.<p></p><p></p><h3><b>Plan Ahead</b></h3><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45ehgee/plan-4/"">Organize all of your materials ahead of time</a>. A speech delivered without its accompanying PowerPoint loses impact. In an interview setting, nothing throws you off like realizing you left your portfolio at home and the only copy of your resume has a coffee ring.<p></p><p></p><h3><b>Set Up Sample Q&A Sessions</b></h3>Before a speech, have your friends and family listen and offer constructive criticism. Do the same before an interview. Bring in your friends, prep them about the company and have them do a mock interview. Or hire a career coach and pay them to help you.<p></p><p></p><h3><b>Get a Good Night's Sleep</b></h3>A tired speaker delivers a tired speech. A tired applicant makes more mistakes and does not have the energy and excitement most companies want in a new hire. Fighting off the nerves to get to bed early can be challenging, but it is worth the effort. A clear head and energetic attitude can help you get past a lot of other uncertainties.<p></p><p></p><h3><b>Arrive Early</b></h3>Having 15 minutes to grab a bottle of water, visit the restroom and calm down makes the entire experience more relaxed. If you are presenting, you may need that time to get organized and set up digital displays. As a job candidate, showing up late is a definite no-no, so arriving early negates the risk. A little bit of traffic or trouble finding parking will not leave you making apologies to your interview panel if you arrived early. Also, those few minutes to calm down and put on your game face are always welcome.<p></p><div><p>If you have prepared properly, practiced speaking, gathered everything you need for the interview and held mock interviews, you will be in good shape to answer questions during job interviews. Practice really does make perfect, and in both interviewing and public speaking, this brings confidence.</p></div>"Interviews,How to Speak Slowly During a Job Interview,"<h1><strong>How to Speak Slowly During a Job Interview</strong></h1><b> </b><p align=""center""></p><b> </b><p>Job interviews can be nerve-wracking. Most of us, when we are nervous, tend to speak faster.Speaking too quickly can hurt your chances of getting a job because it's not the ideal way to sell yourself.</p><p>Hiring managers want candidates who are confident and communicate clearly, as the candidates will be expected to do with customers and coworkers on the job. While everyone understands that it is normal to be nervous during an interview, it is how you handle your nerves that determines how you are perceived. Learn to speak slower during your job interviews by following these three tips.</p> <p></p> <h3><b>1. Practice by Timing Your Rate of Speech</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>Before you attend an interview, sit down and run through a mock interview. If possible, get a friend to help. Have them time you while you are speaking. The average rate of a typical speaker is around 130 to 150 words per minute. Because it can be difficult to gauge time on the fly, read from a prepared sheet of paper that has at least 300 words on it. If you finish that paper or come close to finishing it in a minute, you are speaking too quickly. This will help you gauge whether you speak fast and give you a guideline of where you need to be. Practice reading at the correct pace to help you train your brain for slower speech.</p> <p><b></b></p> <h3><b>2. Learn to Listen</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>If you find yourself forming a response while the interviewer is speaking, this could lead to you rushing once its your turn to speak, and it could also mean that you are not listening effectively. It is important to learn how to listen to the interviewer. They will appreciate the attentiveness, and you wont feel as rushed when it is your time to talk. A pause that forces you to listen all the way through an interviewer's questioncan be useful, especially if the interviewer refers back to something that was said earlier. This technique is used to determine how well you were paying attention. If you were busy thinking about what you were going to say next, chances are you didn't hear what the interviewer had to say.</p> <p><b></b></p> <h3><b>3. Use These Techniques to Relax</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>The more nervous you are, the faster you are going to speak. If you are naturally shy and have issues with public speaking, chances are you are going to speak even faster. Calm your nerves by following these relaxation tips before you go in for your interview:</p><p></p><ul><li>Practice deep breathing.</li><li>Prepare ahead of time for an interview by reading through common interview questions, which will help you feel more confident.</li><li>Visualize the interview beforehand.</li><li>Learn all you can about the company where you will be interviewing, the hiring manager and what their corporate culture is like so you can get an idea of what is expected of you.</li><li>Find out more about the job description and put together a list of questions you may have about the position. The more prepared you feel, the more likely you are to be relaxed.</li></ul><p></p> <p></p> <p>No one is perfect. Chances are you will be a little nervous during your job interview. However, you can surmount these nerves and come across as being cool and collected by taking the time to get prepared.</p> <p></p>"Job Search Tips,Which Jobs Are Insourcing?,"<h1>Which Jobs Are Insourcing?</h1><p>If you have ever lost your job due to outsourcing, you might be interested to learn that many companies have started to insource jobs back to America. It's happening quietly, but major companies are bringing jobs back from overseas. If you want to benefit from this trend, take a look at which companies are insourcing jobs and what it means to you. <br></p> <h3>Reasons for Insourcing <br></h3> <p>As you might guess, money is the main factor behind the decision for many companies to insource jobs. <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/01/11/everything-you-need-know-about-insourcing"">The White House Blog</a> explains that previously low labor costs overseas have been steadily increasing. For some companies it no longer makes financial sense to outsource jobs to countries such as China, India or Mexico. In addition, American workers have become more productive than ever, which is partly why some foreign companies have increasingly chosen to hire Americans. <br></p> <p>Another reason more companies are insourcing positions is the rising cost of transportation. According to <a href=""http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tech-decision-maker/whats-behind-enterprise-insourcing-of-it/"">TechRepublic</a>, a lot of companies are finding it easier to afford transportation and warehousing expenses when their products are made in the U.S. And of course, there is also the political pressure many companies face to keep jobs in this country. When ""Made in America"" is combined with the increasing financial benefits of keeping jobs within American borders, insourcing makes sense for many industries. <br></p> <h3>Industries and Companies That Are Insourcing<em> <br></em></h3> <p>If you're wondering how you can benefit from insourcing, you should first know which fieldsand more specifically, which companiesare taking part in this development.</p><p>Those in the manufacturing industry are likely to be the most affected.</p> <p>Caterpillar, Apple, General Electric and Whirlpool are just some examples of major companies that have recently invested in factories in this country. Master Lock has followed suit, since it has returned its production process to its original location of Milwaukee. According to <a href=""http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-01-12/news/30616823_1_assembly-plant-galaxe-solutions-new-jobs"">The Economic Times</a>, Ford is another company that is now insourcing. The company decided that instead of working on its Fusion in Mexico, production would take place at its Flat Rock plant in Michigan. This alone would add more than 1,200 jobs.<em> <br></em></p> <p>Another example: According to <a href=""http://www.dailyfinance.com/2012/07/20/jobs-insourcing-gets-another-boost-from-starbucks/"">DailyFinance</a>, Starbucks is getting ready to build a major manufacturing facility in Georgia. When it opens in 2014, it will employ about 140 U.S. citizens. The jobs are expected to be highly skilled manufacturing positions. These include: <br></p> <ul><li>Engineering technicians</li><li>Soluble process operators</li><li>Management staff</li><li>Administrative staff</li><li>Roasting operators <br></li></ul> <p>According to <a href=""http://ecosalon.com/the-insourcing-trend-what-is-the-impact-of-clothing-made-in-the-usa/"">EcoSalon</a>, apparel manufacturers have recently begun to consider insourcing an attractive tactic. Major brands that have started insourcing include the following: <br></p> <ul><li>Abercrombie</li><li>Levis</li><li>Karen Kane</li><li>American Giant</li><li>Walmart</li><li>Keen Footwear</li><li>Brooks Brothers</li><li>Opening Ceremony <br></li></ul> <p>Services that include customer support and software development are also insourcing. According to <a href=""http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240169433/Could-GMs-decision-to-insource-IT-start-a-trend"">Computer Weekly</a>, General Motors recently moved its previously outsourced IT jobs back to the U.S., generating thousands of jobs in its new data centers. <br></p> <h3>Leveraging This Trend<br></h3> <p>You now know which industries and some of the companies that are insourcing. How do you get hired for these jobs? Get the right education or training, get your resume together and keep an eye out on the news and on job search engines such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> for manufacturing or software jobs. Bear in mind that, according to <a href=""http://www.governing.com/columns/potomac-chronicle/col-insourcing-jobs-can-only-happen-with-states-help.html"">Governing</a>, you probably won't see the same positions or pay rates that were outsourced years ago, for better and for worse. Many companies now focus on hiring fewer employees who can do more and expect more pay, which means you need skills, especially as they pertain to working with machines.</p>"Job Search Tips,Want a Career at Apple?,"<h2><b>Want a Career at Apple?</b></h2><p></p><p>Even after the passing of Steve Jobs, Apple remains the ultimate leader in technological innovation. It is this qualityalong with such perks as high pay and gadget discountsthat keeps prospective employees applying in droves. Whether you'd like a job at Apple in programming or a gig selling iPads, you'll face stiff competition. Despite its prominence in the world of technology,<a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=AAPL+Profile"">Yahoo Finance</a>reports that Apple only employs 72,800 full-time employees. This might seem like a lot, but keep in mind that it's an international figureand that majorcompetitor<a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=MSFT+Profile"">Microsoft</a>maintains a far larger employee base, with 99,000 professionals on the full-time payroll. Despite the continued high demand for Apple careers, it's still possible to land a job at Apple. To improve your chances at employment, keep the following suggestions in mind.</p><h3><strong>Quality References Are Essential</strong></h3><p>It's no secret that Apple requiresprospective employeesto include detailed references in their job applications. But unlike some of its competitors, the company makes a point of thoroughly checking any and all included references, particularly if any of these listed individuals have a history with Apple. The importance of a good reference for an Apple applicant cannot be understated. Even better than a quality reference is an employee referral. As tech site<a href=""http://www.electricpig.co.uk/2011/02/04/how-to-get-a-job-at-apple/#contact1"">Electric Pig</a>points out, the company is willing to pay current employeesup to $5,000 for excellent referrals. In its earlier days, Apple largely limited its hiring process to referrals, and while it has certainly branched out since then, this still remains the most secure route to scoring a job.<br></p><h3><strong>The Importance of Passion</strong></h3><p>Harboring a passion for your work is always an important quality for landing and keeping a job, no matter the industry. But the importance of this concept is magnified tenfold for current and prospective Apple employees. <a href=""http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2012/08/17/apple-is-hiring-now-the-inside-scoop-on-getting-a-job/"">AOL</a>asked a wide array of former Apple workers about the key to landing a job with the company; all claimed that a burning passion for everything Apple remained an absolute necessity, no matter the level of employment. This is particularly true, however, for retail workers, as customers tend to respond far better to genuinely enthusiastic salespeople, as opposed to employees who are simply putting on a show for the sake of a paycheck. The takeaway here? If you are not genuinely obsessed with Apple products, you might want to consider seeking a job elsewhere. Or you need to become obsessed with apple products,</p><h3><strong>Get Involved</strong></h3><p>If you are, as suggested above, truly passionate about Apple, you won't need to be told to get involved with the company's burgeoning internet community. If you happen to love your iPhone and are hesitant about jumping in at the official support forums, it's time to do so. Hiring stories abound in which internal recruiters snatched enthusiastic parties from the depths of the forums after witnessing exceptional answers to common queries. Apple lovers have also snagged recruiter attention by submitting top-notch applications to the app store. You can find such openings at the store or the headquarters by checking out Apple job postings at <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/search?q=jobs+at+apple&fcn=Apple"">Simply Hired</a>. Basically, the key to getting noticed is getting involved, essentially proving your passion before you ever submit a job application.</p><h3><b>You Can Do It</b></h3><p>Gaining employment with this technology giant is no easy endeavor. Apple careers remain as elusive as ever. But if you possess plenty of passion and a few good references, you just might get a foot in the door.</p>"Resumes,Have I Chosen the Wrong Career?,"<h1><b>Have I Chosen the Wrong Career?</b></h1><p>Is that the fourth or fifth time youve hit the snooze button this morning? Youre not alone. There are days when we dread going to work. There are times (many, in fact) when that Hawaiian vacation cant come soon enough. However, theres a difference between a bad day (or week) at work and the realization you've chosen the wrong career. You can shake off the Monday blues, but if youve chosen the wrong career, chances are those blues have turned into something more dispiriting. Here are seven signs youre on the wrong career path.<br></p><p></p><h3><b>1. You feel as if youre underemployed</b></h3><p>The skills and talents you highlighted on your resume are not being utilized. Heres the catch. Feeling as if youre underemployed is different than feeling as if youre overqualified for a job. In other words, when you are underemployed, you have the skills and the job youre at requires those skills, but youre not being called on to perform them.<br></p><p></p><h3><b>2. Boredom</b></h3><p>Everyone has mornings when getting out of bed is difficult. There is tedious paperwork to do at the office. Your boss gives the same speech every Friday. Work is predictable, right? While there's always going to be a fair amount of boredom with any routine, if youre work doldrums begin to affect other parts of your life, <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/learnvest/2013/10/16/3-telltale-signs-youre-on-the-wrong-career-path/"">then there is a problem</a>. </p><p></p><h3><b>3. Depression</b></h3><p>According to the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/features/dsdepression/"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, 1 in 10 people suffers from depression. From sadness and lethargy to an inability to sleep or concentrate, there are many signs and symptoms of depression. If you feel your career is adding to your depression, then it's time to reconsider. </p><p></p><h3><b>4. Tension, stress and problems at home</b></h3><p>Despite the fact you want to leave work at work, you cant. We are all guilty of this to some degree. It's fine until your job begins to affect your home life, social life and relationships with other people. After a while, unusual hours or 100-hour workweeks are going to take their toll on other parts of your life. </p><p></p><h3><b>5. You want to be anywhere else but at work</b></h3><p>Daydreams are one thing, but if you would rather sit in a room and watch paint dry than go work, then you chose the wrong career. Sure, not every day at work is going to be rich and satisfying. However, if youre distracted, unfocused and absent-minded day in and day out, you might as well be working somewhere else. </p><p></p><h3><b>6. A sense of failure</b></h3><p>How do you measure career success? Is it by the amount of money you make? Is it earned by climbing up the ladder through hard work and dedication? The idea of success varies from person to person; however, a growing sense of failure is a sign youve chosen the wrong career path. </p><p></p><h3><b>7. Life is short</b></h3><p><a></a></p><p>If you wake up in the morning, hit the snooze button four or five times and ask yourself if youve chosen the wrong career, then chances are you have. Questioning your career on a regular basis is a telltale sign youre on the wrong path.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Career,The 10 Largest Employers in the U.S.,"<h1>The 10 Largest Employers in the U.S.</h1><div><p></p></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><p></p><p>If you're looking for a job, consider applying to one of the largest employers in the country. These are businesses with a proven track record in hiring, whether they deal with fast food, retail or technology. If you want to know which major companies to consider during your job search, check out this list of employers, each of which keeps at least 300,000 people employed.<br></p> <h3>1. Walmart <br></h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/08/22/ten-largest-employers/2680249/"">USA Today</a>, Walmart is the largest employer in the nation. The company employs 2.2 million people globally, with 1.8 million of those Americans. The majority of the jobs are in retail, which the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/sales/retail-sales-workers.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> cites as a growing field. <br></p> <h3>2. Yum! Brands <br></h3> <p>This company owns Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell, and it employs about 523,000 people. As you might guess, the main industry of this company is fast food. Like retail, the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Food-Preparation-and-Serving/Food-and-beverage-serving-and-related-workers.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> claims this field is set to grow in coming years. <br></p> <h3>3. McDonald's <br></h3> <p>This is yet another company in the fast food industry, which means you can expect to see job growth here. In fact, USA Today reports that McDonald's added <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/08/22/ten-largest-employers/2680249/"">62,000 new jobs in 2011</a>, bringing its total number of employees to about 440,000. <br></p> <h3>4. IBM <br></h3> <p>To work at IBM, you should probably be highly skilled in the technology industry. While technology is clearly here to stay, IBM itself is not necessarily poised for growth. IBM employs 434,000 people, but its workers have been subject to major layoffs.<br></p> <h3>5. United Parcel Service <br></h3> <p>UPS employs <a href=""http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/about/facts/worldwide.html"">399,000</a> people in the freight and delivery industry. Though many of its current employees work part-time, <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/31/us-ups-idUSTRE80U0YW20120131"">Reuters</a> reports that this company has been growing and will likely continue. This is due to the popularity of shopping online, which has become even more commonplace with the growth of smartphones. <br></p> <h3>6. Target <br></h3> <p>Target employs about 361,000 people, which increases to around 409,000 during the holidays. These jobs are in the growing retail industry, and the positions include cashiers, stockers and managers. <br></p> <h3>7. Kroger <br></h3> <p>More than 343,000 people work at this giant grocery store chain. The stores have different names across the country, with some of the most well-known grocery stores being Harris Teeter, Fry's, Ralph's, Food 4 Less and King Soopers. Both this company and the retail industry have shown signs of growth.<br></p> <h3>8. Home Depot <br></h3> <p>Home Depot employs about 340,000 people. If you want a job as a cashier, stocker or customer service associate working in the home improvement industry, this store is your best bet. After all, there are about 2,000 Home Depot locations in this country, so it's likely that you can find one near you. <br></p> <h3>9. Hewlett-Packard <br></h3> <p>Like the other technology company on this list, this employer has undertaken massive layoffs in the past. It currently employs 331,800. <br></p> <h3>10. General Electric <br></h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/23/americas-5-biggest-employ_n_736215.html#s143990&title=3_General_Electric"">Huffington Post</a>, General Electric is the smallest of the ten largest employers. This company employs about 304,000, which shows major growth for this conglomerate business. While it used to be considered an industrial firm in the 1950s, it now makes much of its profit from the financial services it provides.</p>"Career,5 Jobs with Great Perks,"<h1><b>5 Astounding Perks at Jobs You've Never Considered</b></h1><p>When it's time to choose a job, cash is nice, but what are the perks? Don't laugh. It's an important question.</p><p>In so many cases, experiences trump things when it comes to overall happiness. That's the conclusion from a number of studies on behavioral science presented by <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/hbsworkingknowledge/2013/08/05/want-to-buy-happiness-purchase-an-experience/"">Michael Norton</a>, associate professor of marketing at Harvard.</p><p>""One of the most common things people do with their money is get stuff, but we have shownin research that stuff isnt good for you,"" Norton said. ""It doesnt make you unhappy, but it doesnt make you happy. But one thing that does make us happy is an experience.""</p> <p>Instead of exploring experiences, though, many of us divide our time between sleeping and working. The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently revealed a <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/#work"">chart on time use</a> showing that on average we are spending 54 percent of our waking lives on work-related tasks. It's actually getting worse because mobile devices and cloud-based software have made it far easier to take work home, on the road and even on vacation with us.</p><p>If you are going to spend that much of your life on something, make it count.

It's an effort that pays for itself and then some. Want a bigger paycheck for your next job? Then you must ask for a raise while in your current job. The more money you make now, the more you can command in the future.Here are some tips on how to ask for a raise (and get it).</p> <h3><b>Research First</b></h3><p></p> <p>Find out who makes the<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-keating/six-steps-to-asking-for-a_b_3694758.html"">salary decisions </a>in your company, and start planning three months in advance. Accurately assess your job accomplishments for the last 12 months. Show your manager how you have contributed to the company's bottom line. Provide facts and stats. Research salary levels for similar job titles, workloads and industries.</p> <h3><b>Assertiveness Pays Off</b></h3> <p>It's important to <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-schwimmer/how-to-ask-for-a-raisewit_b_3804944.html"">be assertive</a> when asking for a raise. Be professional, positive, honest and direct with your manger. Employees who are too aggressive, who demand a raise or give ultimatums, stand a chance of getting fired. The opposite of this is being passive, of expecting to get a raise simply because you do your job. Take the initiative and strike just the right balance.</p> <h3><b>Practice Your Pitch</b></h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2013/03/05/seven-steps-to-take-before-you-ask-for-a-raise/"">Forbes</a>, practicing what you are going to say to your manager builds confidence. You can rehearse with a family member, friend or coach. It's also a good way to practice handling the objections your manger may confront you with. Prepare answers for objections such as ""We have no budget for a raise"" or ""It's not the right time for a salary review."" Come up with strong, logical answers to possible objections.</p> <h3><b>Conducting the Meeting</b></h3> <p>Schedule a salary review meeting with your manager. Let them know what the meeting is about. It's best to choose a time when things aren't hectic. Even better is to choose a time when things are going well in the company. At the meeting, focus on your accomplishments, your value to the company and your work ethic. A written list of your successful projects and their results should be used for reference. Make a copy for your manager. Request a raise based on your job performance and how it has contributed to he overall benefit of the company. Make it clear that you understand your worth as an employee.</p> <h3><b>What Not to Say</b></h3> <p>When discussing a salary increase, don't mention your debts, expenses or bills. Don't expect a raise based on financial need. Avoid looking desperate. Instead focus on the value your skills and job performance bring to the company. Asking for too much money also reduces your chances of getting a raise. Research, research, research before walking into the meeting.</p> <h3><b>Getting the Raise</b></h3> <p>If you manager denies your raise, all is not lost. During your meeting you can discuss your professional goals and aspirations and get feedback about your job performance and how you can improve. Ask for a re-evaluation in a few months. During this time, try to take on more responsibilities. Keep track of work-related accomplishments and learn to subtly self-promote. If you can show how your performance impacts the company, you have a better chance of getting that raise.</p>"Resumes,Pyschology Careers,"<div><div><div><h1>Psychology Careers</h1><p></p></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div>If you enjoy observing and analyzing the behavior of others, you should consider a career in psychology. Your options depend on your specific interests within the field of psychology as well as the amount of time you are willing to spend in school. While you will find that you have more choices available when you have a master's or doctorate degree, there are still ways to work in psychology with a bachelor's degree. This overview of jobs will give you some idea of how far you can go with each level of education. <br><h3>Substance Abuse and Behavioral Disorder Counselor <br></h3> <p>If you want to help people overcome addictions or destructive behavior, becoming a counselor is one way to do so. According to the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/substance-abuse-and-behavioral-disorder-counselors.htm#tab-4"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, this career sometimes only requires a high school diploma, though you must have a master's degree in order to counsel patients one-on-one. This could be an ideal job while you study psychology in college to get your bachelor's or master's degree, because it will give you some work experience before you graduate or become licensed. Salary varies depending on your level of education and experience, but the median pay is about $38,000. <br></p> <h3>Psychiatric Technician <br></h3> <p>This psychology job involves offering therapeutic care for people who are developmentally disabled or suffering from mental illness.

There are hundreds of different jobs that involve working with animals. Here are five of them that allow you to work closely with animals every day.</p><h3>Animal Groomer</h3><p></p><p>Animal groomers clean, brush and trim animals' coats, clip their nails, brush their teeth and perform other grooming tasks. Groomers can specialize in household pets, such as dogs, or larger animals, such as horses. A pet groomer can learn the trade either through on-the-job training or by attending a state-licensed grooming school. Groomers work in grooming businesses, pet supply stores, kennels and stables.</p><p></p><p>Becoming an animal groomer is a also good job for someone who wants to own their own business or who has a rapport with both animals and people. In 2010, the median pay for animal care and service workers was $19,780 per year, and the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/"">annual job growth</a> for the next decade is expected to be greater than average.</p><h3>Animal Trainer</h3><p></p><p>If you have an affinity for a specific animal species, becoming an animal trainer allows you to use your ""animal-whisperer"" skills with your favorite animal. People most commonly train dogs or horses, but there are also trainers for marine animals, circus animals and TV and movie animals.</p><p></p><p><a></a>Dogs are trained for the widest variety of tasks. They provide security, assist people with disabilities and work as police dogs, search and rescue dogs and pet therapy animals. To become a trainer, you will need to complete training and acquire the certification of the governing body for your specialty. For example, dog trainers should be Certified Pet Dog Trainers, and service animal (working dog) trainers need extra training for their occupation.</p><h3>Wildlife Rehabilitator</h3><p></p><p>For those who want to help wild animals and birds, wildlife rehabilitation offers a rewarding career. For a job in this field, you should have at least a university degree in biology or ecology, and you must complete courses and seminars to learn how to care for wildlife and qualify for government-issued licenses and permits.</p><p></p><p>Job duties vary widely, and many require specialized skills. The <a href=""http://www.nwrawildlife.org/"">National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association</a>recently listed over 40 open jobs ranging from internships to executive director positions. Income depends on the type of job, but it is comparable to similar work in other nonprofit organizations.</p><h3>Veterinary Technician</h3><p></p><p>Veterinary technicians are a vital part of animal medicine and health. They work with veterinarians, performing medical tests and assisting in the treatment of ill or injured animals.</p><p></p><p>To become a veterinary technician, you need a two-year associate's degree in a post-secondary VT program. With a more advanced, four-year bachelor's degree you can become a veterinary technologist. VTs earned a median pay of $39,710 per year in 2010, and the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/"">job outlook</a> is excellent, with demand predicted to grow by 52 percent in the next 10 years.</p><h3>Veterinarian</h3><p></p><p>The profession of veterinarian is the highest paying one in animal care and also the one requiring the most education. To become a veterinarian, you must complete an accredited program at a college of veterinary medicine. Admission is competitive, and most applicants already have a bachelor's degree. After receiving a DVM, veterinarians can train in 40 different specialties. A veterinarian can expect to earn between $50,000 and $145,000 a year, depending on the type of practice. Interestingly, the lowest starting salary is for vets who work with horses, perhaps because these jobs take place outside of high-cost cities.</p><p></p><p>Careers with animals cover such a broad range of possibilities that anyone who loves working with animals and is motivated and educated should be able to build a satisfying future in this field.</p><p><a href=""http://www.nwrawildlife.org""></a></p>"Interviews,How to Make Math Work for You,"<h1>How to Make Math Work for You</h1><p>Good mathematical skills are important in many careers.

But as the <a href=""http://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/choosing-a-practical-major/?_r=0 "">New York Times</a> points out, not all STEM degrees are equal when it comes to employment prospects, though. Some majors garner more interviews than others. If you've been thinking about pursuing science careers after college, consider one or more of these fascinating and potentially profitable jobs.</p><h3><strong>Biochemistry</strong></h3><p>Sitting at the crossroads between the disparate fields of biology and chemistry is biochemistry, an applied science that focuses on chemical processes as they relate to living organisms. Biochemistry programs abound, with students studying organic chemistry, microbiology and everything in between. Upon graduation, many pursue careers in the medical field, while a significant minority find employment as nutrition and agricultural consultants.</p><h3><strong>Environmental Science</strong></h3><p>Concerns related to environmental degradation continue to weigh heavily on the minds of many. Environmental scientists are charged with the challenging task of addressing such issues as climate change, diminishing biodiversity and genetic modifications. Students hoping to pursue careers as environmental scientists are encouraged to major in the related fields of ecology, geology or biology. Several schools have set up interdisciplinary environmental science programs in which all of these topics are addressed in relationship to current events; such majors are, when available, worthwhile.</p><h3><strong>Hydrology</strong></h3><p>Students with hydrology majors spend their days studying the movement and distribution of water. First, though, they must establish solid backgrounds in geology, chemistry and environmental science. The career prospects for hydrology students are surprisingly diverse, with many entering various state departments of natural resources as licensed hydrologists. The efforts of publicly and privately employed hydrologists are necessary for the continued maintenance of functioning water systems, both natural and man-made.</p><h3><strong>Biomedical Engineering</strong></h3><p>Struggling to choose between a science or engineering program? By focusing onbiomedical engineering, you can pursue both fields of study at once. This field involves the application of general concepts related to engineering into real-life medical situations. Current biomedical engineers work on everything from the development of new devices for cancer treatment to the implantation of microchips for medical tracking. The most direct route to this career path will involve enrolling in an accredited biomedical engineering undergraduate program, where students primarilytake courses in chemical engineering andbiochemistry. A more general double major in engineering and either biology or chemistry should also prove sufficient for setting aspiring biomedical engineers on the right track.</p><h3><strong>Nuclear Physics</strong></h3><p>Contrary to popular belief, those employed in the field of nuclear physics do not necessarily work in or around nuclear power plants. Although such energy sources do serve as a major employer for nuclear physicists, these scientists' expertise is also required in such diverse areas as radiocarbon dating, magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear weapons technology. Undergraduate degrees in nuclear physics are available at several universities. Students can also pursue this career path by majoring in general physics and then applying for doctorate candidacy in the nuclear concentration.</p><p>As the Huffington Post alleges,careers in biochemistry, nuclear physics and other areas hold great promise for those willing to put in the hard work of studying for a college degree. With a strong background in STEM, college grads can ensure that their science expertise leads them straight to gainful employment.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><p style=""background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250);""></p><p></p>"Job Search Tips,How to Get a Government Job,"<div><div><div><h1>How to Get a Government Job</h1><p></p></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div>Stable employment, phenomenal benefits and a retirement package that cannot be beat make are why so many job seekers look for government jobs. As a result, it can be difficult to get hired in today's competitive job market with more highly qualified people applying for government positions. Getting to the top of the list for consideration and making it through the interview process takes time and keen attention to detail. Follow these seven steps to maximize your hiring potential for a government job.<div><h3><b>1. Do the research</b></h3>The federal hiring landscape has changed significantly over the last decade. Even entry-level positions set a high bar in terms of employee qualifications. It's easy to think of the <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2012/11/14/5-tips-for-getting-a-government-job/"">federal government</a> as a single employer, but the reality is that it is made up of hundreds of departments, all with their own areas of focus. And that's just at the federal level. The government employs individuals at the state and county levels, too. Before submitting applications, take the time to think about which departments best fit your interests.<br><h3><b>2. Know where to look</b></h3></div><div>The government posts all job listings publicly, but that doesn't help unless you know where to find them. <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>links to government job postings for many different types of positions. Start there.<br><h3><b>3. Network effectively</b></h3></div><div>Friends, family, co-workers, teachers and acquaintances form a broad base of people who might have insider knowledge about job openings. Work those connections to find out exactly what available positions entail and which skills hiring teams prize most.<br><h3><b>4. Tailor your resume</b></h3>Writing a resume for government work is different than writing one for the private sector. Because hundreds of people apply for each position, an easy-to-read resume nets much better results than a complex one. Consider breaking skills out into bullet-point list, and use the exact keywords applicable to the desired position. Many HR departments now use software searches to find the most qualified candidates. They only return results on keyword matches, so make sure your resume fits the criteria. Also, remember to list <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-51344044/government-jobs-how-to-get-them/"">quantifiable results</a>. Provide instances where money was saved, man-hours were reduced or processes were improved. Yes, the government does those things. Sometimes.</div><div><h3><b>5. Find another job in the meantime</b></h3></div><div>The government hiring process can take up to a year. It often lasts more than six months, leaving many job seekers struggling to make ends meet while waiting for the job they want.<br><h3><b>6. Study for the test</b></h3></div><div>Many federal jobs require a ""Knowledge Skills and Abilities"" document from potential hires. This provides an opportunity for applicants to give anecdotal examples of their skills and past successes. It is important to be both eloquent and honest, because the government will probably call references to verify the facts detailed in a KSA.<br><h3><b>7. Monitor your social media</b></h3></div><div>Many government organizations have severe restrictions about posting to social media. Before you submit your application, take a look at your activity on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other sites. Take down anything that presents an unprofessional image. Be sure to look at your photographs. Sometimes, a picture tells a story that does not fit with the image you are creating. The <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/07/tech/social-media/companies-social-media/index.html"">National Labor Relations Board</a> (NLRB) has started to regulate what employers can and cannot demand from employees on social networks, but this is a new and gray area. You have the right to free speech, but until all the legal issues surrounding social network sites have been resolved, it is probably best to minimize and sanitize your social media footprint.<div><div><p><br>Much of applying for government jobs is a waiting game. It may take a long time before you have a job offer in hand. Government jobs offer unparalleled job security and high pay, making them highly desirable.

Hiring post-GFC (Global Financial Crisis) has changed for the better in SOME ways. Compensation packages include more comprehensive benefits and online resources allow job seekers to easily compare average salary ranges. Ultimately, this allows many who are new to the job market to have the same negotiating skills as those with years of experience. Below are the three most common benefits included in a total compensation package for a full time job.</p><div><ol><li><b>Health benefits</b>: Some 85 percent of full-time employees in the private sector have access to employer-provided health care, according to the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ebs2.pdf"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Workers are not required to enroll in workplace insurance, but it is available as part of total compensation. Small businesses that do not have to offer it. Companies with fewer than 50 employees are not required to include healthcare benefits, so be sure to ask about this before accepting a position at a small company.</li><li><b>Retirement benefits</b>: Whether it is a 401(k) with an employer match, stock options or a funded pension plan, <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ebs2.pdf"">74 percent</a> of those employed in the private sector can enroll in retirement benefits when hired as a full-time employee. Larger companies offer retirement benefits more often than smaller companies, but even those that employ fewer than 100 people offer these benefits approximately 50 percent of the time. The trick is to find a company that offers the right <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/17/jobs/for-many-full-time-work-means-part-time-benefits.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm"">mix of benefits</a> for you.</li><li><b>Paid Time Off (PTO</b>): This addition to a compensation package comes in two different types: sick leave and vacation time. Companies handle PTO in a variety of different ways, but <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ebs2.pdf"">74 percent of employees</a> have access to paid sick leave. In some instances, sick leave and vacation time are broken into separate accruals. For example, you might receive two weeks of vacation time and five days of sick leave. This works out to a total of three weeks of PTO. However, you cannot schedule sick time in advance, and typically, if you are at home for sick leave for more than two days, you need to get a note from your doctor. Other companies combine sick time and vacation time into a total pool of PTO. This means that all of the time can be used for any purpose, but once it is used, additional time off is unpaid.</li></ol><div><p>The benefits you receive from full-time work tell only part of the story. What you are expected to provide to your employer in return tells the rest. Full-time employees cost more than part-time ones, but they have <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/debbie-robins/ceos-consciousness-and-cu_b_1148752.html"">additional value</a>for employers.</p></div></div><div><ul><li><b>Lower turnover</b>: As a full-time employee, you will be expected to stay in that job longer and give notice if you are intending to leave. Some states have employment laws that compel a full-time worker to provide a minimum notice, and even in states with at-will employment laws, it is considered polite. Lack of notice can come back to haunt you when applying for other jobs.</li><li><b>Mandatory overtime</b>: Whether you are salaried or hourly, your employer might need you to put in more than 40 hours in a given work week. Be prepared to meet those demands and put in the time when necessary.</li><li><b>Better quality work</b>: Employees in training make more mistakes than experienced workers. Full-time workers have more time each week to learn the ins and outs of a job. Your employer will expect more from you when they offer you a full time job than from a part-timer in the same department.</li></ul></div>"Interviews,Job Search Every Day,"<h1><b>Job Search Every Day</b></h1> <p>According to a January 2013 article in <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2013/01/10/seven-strategies-to-reboot-your-job-search-in-2013/"">Forbes</a>, more than 12 million individuals were unemployed and 86 percent of those employed were interested in finding new jobs. These figures add up to one competitive job market, which means that finding suitable employment can take months or even longer. Whether you are currently employed and looking for a new position, or you are unemployed, it is all too easy to get discouraged. The key to finding a job is making the effort to do something for your job search every single day. This will help you stay motivated and greatly increase your chances of finding the position you really want.</p> <h3><b>Set Daily Goals to Hold Yourself Accountable</b></h3> <p>Recruiter and career coach<a href=""http://www.expectingchange.com/doing-something-every-day-to-move-your-job-search-forward/"">Andrea Ballard</a>says that you should determine what you want to doevery day while seeking a job. Whether it is finding three jobs for which you are qualified to apply or contacting 10 companies every day to check for openings, you need to have an actual goal that you want to accomplish. This will help you stay motivated and also make you feel as though you are doing something to move your search in the right direction. Utilize job alerts to stay on top of new positions as they come open so that you will have a steady stream of new possibilities.</p> <p>Creating a routine is helpful when it comes to searching for a job, particularly if you are unemployed. Instead of watching television or surfing the Internet, create a routine that will help structure your daily efforts for finding a job. Get up, get cleaned up and dressed, and approach your search as if it were your real job. This will help you stay motivated and keep you in good habits for the workforce.</p> <p>Setting goals and task lists for each day will help you hold yourself accountable. Its all too easy when you are unemployed to get discouraged and feel like you are wasting your time. Some job seekers end up depressed and lose hope. By keeping yourself on task, Ballard says, you will be doing something every day that will eventually lead to your getting a job.</p> <h3><b>Include Volunteer Work as Part of Your Search</b></h3> <p>It is important to get out of the house and be proactive. Once you reach your goals for the day, try getting out and volunteering to help those who are less fortunate.This can be a very powerful way to find a job. In fact, a recent <a href=""http://www.unitedway.org/blog/entry/can-volunteering-help-you-with-your-job-search/"">study</a> showed that those who accepted volunteer positions boosted their chances of finding employment by 27 percent.The reason for this is simple: you will be meeting other people and networking, which may lead you to the right person who knows of a position that you would be perfect for. Volunteering also helps fight depression and keeps your outlook positive.</p> <h3><b>Improve Your Current Skills</b></h3> <p>Another great way you can advance your search is by improving your skill set while you are looking for a job. Certified career management coach<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2013/01/10/seven-strategies-to-reboot-your-job-search-in-2013/"">Carol Camerino</a>told Forbes that there are several ways to do this. You can take an unpaid internship to obtain marketable skills, take certification courses or attend classes that will help you further your career in the future. You can find free classes online that will assist you in developing your skill sets and improving your knowledge base. Update your resume as you finish these courses and make sure you include your volunteer work as well.</p> <p>All of these components are designed to help you improve yourself as a candidate and keep the right perspective on your job search. Stay proactive and keep your job search going until you find the right fit for you. It might take time, but with perseverance and a good attitude, you will find it.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>"Career,Everything You Need to Know About Amazon Careers,"<h1>Everything You Need to Know about Amazon Careers and Warehouse Jobs</h1><p>Headquartered in Seattle, Amazon is the largest online retailer on the planet.

And the best ones? You never hear about those. When it comes down to it, chances are that whoever is landing those jobs has done their homework and is a step ahead of the rest of the pack. No one ever said you can't try to get a job from a company <a href=""http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2011/01/31/how-to-get-a-job-before-its-posted/"">before it announces that it's hiring</a>. All's fair in love and employment. If you want a job at a certain company, put forth the time and effort to get that job before anyone else finds out about it. Here are tips for getting noticed by a company that isn't currently hiring:</p><h3><b>Lay the Groundwork; Do your Homework</b></h3><p>Start by targeting the company you want to work for. After you've done that, research the heck out of the company and make sure that you're totally informed about what they do, how they operate, who you'll be dealing with in the interview process and even who you'd eventually be working with should you be hired. If you have contacts at the company, this would be a good time to ask them questions about the inner workings of the organization. Don't forget to search for contacts on LinkedIn.</p><h3><b>Get a Referral</b></h3><p>If you know someone who works for the company, ask for a referral. With more and more companies looking internally for solutions to their the hiring dilemmas, knowing someone on the inside will give you an advantage. Not only will one of their current employees be singing your praises, but the hiring manager might also look at you as someone who already has an idea of what the job will entitle, the expectations, etc., all of which make you appear more desirable to the company.</p><h3><b>Have Them Make the Call</b></h3><p>Are you on good terms with your previous hiring manager? If you are, ask that person if they would be willing to call the company and give you a recommendation. A call from one hiring manager to another on your behalf not only shows that they were happy with your work, but that you left on good terms. These are all things that a hiring manager would want to hear about a potential employee, <a href=""http://blog.brazencareerist.com/2013/08/27/6-innovative-ways-to-really-get-noticed-by-a-hiring-manager/"">which will make you much more memorable</a>.</p><h3>Send Your Resume and Keep in Touch</h3><div>When attempting to get noticed at a place where you want to work, use your networking skills to get a resume to the manager of the section of the company where you want to work. You should also send a pitch to them about why they should keep you in mind for future openings; what problems do they have that you could help solve? Speak to their ""pain points"" and you just might get their attention. If you don't hear from them right away, keep in touch and keep them updated about any changes in your professional life or added training or special accomplishments; this gives you another reason to send an email, and it<a href=""http://mailbag.penelopetrunk.com/2013/04/11/how-do-i-get-a-job-at-a-company-that-is-not-hiring/"">keeps you on their mind</a>.</div><div><br></div><p>By following these tips, you will have an advantage over other the other job applicants, because the manager of the department that you are interested in will think of you when he needs an employee.

You start applying to every job you can find. If youre even remotely qualified, you apply. In interviews, you say all the wrong things. Unfortunately, thats not an effective way to land a job. A good job search strategy can make the difference between perpetual frustration and finding a great job. And your new strategy might produce results sooner than you think.</p><h3>Identify the Fulfilling Job You Want</h3><p>First you need to find a job.

By discovering what would make your job fulfilling, you can resolve the mismatch between your skills and the jobs that are available.</p><p>Think about the industries in which you would like to work and the functions you would like to fill.

Although organizing such an adventure can seem overwhelming, it is not an unreachable goal. In fact, more than six million Americans are living abroad and working overseas right now. There are five important factors to consider when planning to travel and work overseas:</div><h3>1. Passport and Visas</h3><div>Americans who wish to travel internationally for any reason, be it pleasure or work, must hold a valid passport. If you do not yet have yours, you can find information on applying for one on the <a href=""http://travel.state.gov/passport/"">U.S. Department of State</a> website. Within that passport, you will need the proper visa in order to obtain work overseas.<br><br>A<b> </b>visa<b> </b>is a document that every traveler needs to be allowed to visit another country, and it is granted by the country you want to visit. For example, if you want to travel to the United Kingdom, your visa is granted by official representatives of the United Kingdom. Sometimes you need not apply for these visas, as they are simply given as stamps in one's passport upon entry to another country. If you want to work, however, you will need to apply through a relevant embassy in your own country. Most countries are represented by an official embassy or consulate within the United States, and they can be contacted by American citizens who want to apply for a work visa. So long as the correct visa is granted to you, you may work for American or foreign employers. To find the embassy or consulate of your desired destination, consult <a href=""embassy-finder.com"">Embassy Finder.</a> <br><br>Get in touch with the proper embassy to confirm its rules concerning Americans and work visas and make an application.<br><h3>2. Accommodation<br></h3>Accommodation is usually easy to find, and in most places you can rent an apartment or house in your own name so long as you have a passport and a bank account. Buying a home is much more complicated, so rentals are the ideal choice. If you choose to rent a house or apartment, look through local real estate listings for the area in which you want to live. Never send money to a realtor or landlord until you have physically viewed the property and discussed a rental contract. Online realty listings can give you a good idea of the price for accommodation in your chosen area, as well as information about damage deposits and other rental-related bills.<br><br>If you are traveling for a relatively short period of time--say a month or so--you can find a wonderful selection of accommodation options on <a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/?af=1922719&c=A_TC%3Ddxwjzz3wec%26G_MT%3De%26G_CR%3D22111491256%26G_N%3Dg%26G_K%3Dair%20b%20n%20b%26G_P%3D&gclid=CLbQ-pWturoCFeHm7AodwzsA6A"">Air BnB. </a>This is an especially helpful website to check if you are looking for an overseas summer job or volunteer work. Through this website you can not only find private accommodation but arrange to stay with a family or other travelers.<br></div><h3>3. Health Coverage</h3><div>Americans working abroad should purchase health insurance to ensure they are covered for medical emergencies. Doctor visits and medications will usually need to be paid by the patient in full, depending on the stipulations of your work visa. For regularly-updated information about health care and other issues for Americans working in foreign countries, visit the <a href=""http://americansabroad.org/issues/healthcare/aca-health-insurance/"">Americans Abroad</a> website. Check with your current or potential insurer to see if it willcover you while you are not a resident of the United States.<br><h3><b>4. Banking</b></h3></div><div>Banking in most countries is as simple as opening a checking account with a small deposit and a passport. The complications arise when you want to transfer funds between an American account and an international account. Be prepared and remember that, usually, only holiday-resort locations deal with traveler's checks. A credit card, as well as most debit cards, work internationally, but you should inform your credit company ahead of time that you will be relocating so that purchases outside your region don't cause the card to be frozen.<br><h3>5. Where to Find Overseas Jobs</h3><p>The internet is your most valuable tool in the search for an overseas job. Knowing where to search is dependent on choosing an industry and choosing a location. If you have decided where you want to find a job, then a good place to start looking is in the local online newspapers and job boards. You will find a much wider selection of jobs if you look at local city publications than if you do a general search. <br></p><p>If you aren't really sure about which city you want, but you have decided on a country, then online job search engines such as<a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> can be a big help. There are 24 country-specific Simply Hired pages where you can search through jobs based on your industry interests or by keywords.

They are employed by organizations that are looking for very specific characteristics in a potential employee. That means headhunters work for businesses, not individuals. For a corporate entity, working with a headhunter means spending a lot less time thumbing through resumes and job applications. For highly-skilled job candidates, working with a headhunter means foregoing the normal job application process.</p><p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p>In an article in <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/headhunters-reveal-11-ways-to-ruin-your-chances-of-getting-a-job-2011-6?op=1"">Business Insider</a>, Judith Aquino says that working with a headhunter is a great way to get a leg up for job seekers. After all, headhunters have ""insider"" knowledge of current and upcoming job openings that have not and will not be advertised. However, communicating with a headhunter should not completely replace your own efforts at locating a new job. Instead, they should be treated as an additional resource.</p> <p><b></b></p> <h3><b>Get Spotted by Headhunters</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>The first thing to know is that you dont usually find headhunters, they find you. Unlike recruitment firms, headhunters <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/headhunters-reveal-11-ways-to-ruin-your-chances-of-getting-a-job-2011-6?op=1"">work for the company</a>. When they successfully fill a position, they get paid by the organization that hired them. That said, there are ways to ensure that you catch the attention of a headhunter:</p> <p></p> <p></p><ul><li>Be highly skilled. Headhunters look for the best of the best in career fields.<br></li><li>Work your way to upper management or to an executive level position in a company. The more impressive your resume, the more likely you are to benefit from collaboration with a headhunter. Business executives, top-level chefs and managers from niche markets such as construction and other trades are prime candidates for headhunters. If you are at the top of your current career chain, you can bet that someone has their eye on you.<br></li><li>Be employed. Companies want to see candidates who are <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/headhunters-reveal-11-ways-to-ruin-your-chances-of-getting-a-job-2011-6?op=1"">gainfully employed</a>;a headhunter is less likely to contact you if you are out of work.<br></li><li>Keep your online presence squeaky clean. Update your LinkedIn profile and make sure that it is impressive. Be careful about what type of status updates and pictures you post on Facebook and other social media sites. Remember, a headhunters <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/headhunters-reveal-11-ways-to-ruin-your-chances-of-getting-a-job-2011-6?op=1"">reputation</a> hinges on presenting the best, low-risk candidates to their clients. If your online presence does not reflect professionalism and responsibility, you may miss out on a headhunters phone call.<br></li></ul><p></p> <p></p> <p>You can also make it easier for headhunters to <a href=""http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/10-secrets-getting-yourself-headhunted/"">find you</a> by networking with other individuals in your career field. Carry and pass out your own business cards whenever you meet new colleagues or business associates. Keep your LinkedIn detailed and up to date. Headhunters are secretive about their recruitment strategies, but if you are open about sharing your professional skills and goals, they will find you.</p><h3>Who Won't Get Contacted by Headhunters?</h3><p></p> <p>Few job seekers will cross paths with a headhunter. If you are a high-level executive or a highly-skilled tradesperson, then you qualify for a headhunter's services. If you are a mid-level employee or lower, you should concentrate on creating a great resume and cover letter, or sign up with a recruitment agency to find good job placement. If you are looking for a career change or simply trying to find employment at an intermediate or novice level, and you want outside help, an agency is where you should focus your attention.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"Job Search Tips,Free Resume Builders,"<h1>Free Resume Builders</h1><p>For those who need help putting together a resume, a resume builder may be just the thing.

Professionals in this industry may concentrate on any number of niche markets, such as sports dieting, weight loss or neonatal dieting. People in this industry make an average of <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/01/03/the-least-stressful-jobs-of-2013/"">$53,000</a> per year.<br></p><h3>Librarian <br></h3><p>Many book lovers dream of being a librarian, but they don't often consider it a well-paid position. It turns out that the average librarian's salary is actually <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/01/03/the-least-stressful-jobs-of-2013/"">$55,000</a> per year, which is a good, solid wage. Librarians are responsible for deciding which books to order for the library, as well as keeping materials properly cataloged and organized. Librarians can be employed privately, by schools or most often by the government.</p><h3>Tutor</h3><p>Tutors can work for themselves or through an agency. With a teaching degree or a degree relevant to your field, the pay grade and career prospects will be much higher. Bilingual tutors need not carry a certificate, however, as their natural language skills are enough to tutor children and adults who want to learn a second language. Being a tutor is much less stressful than being a full-time teacher, because the work can be done anywhere and at any time and there are far fewer children to manage. The average yearly earnings for a skilled tutor are<a href=""http://www.indeed.com/salary/Tutor.html""> $57,000</a>.<br></p><h3>Audiologist <br></h3><p>Audiologists test and treat hearing and balance disorders. To find a job as an audiologist, you must be licensed as a Doctor of Audiology, at which point you can practice in a variety of settings. Audiologists often practice alongside other specialist doctors, such as optometrists. They are regularly asked to visit schools and administer hearing tests as well as offer advice to parents concerning children's auditory health.

Many people resort to writing this way because they believe it sounds formal and professional. George Orwell astutely <a href=""https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm"">lampooned this style of writing</a> in his still fresh essay, <i>Politics and the English Language</i>, advocating:</p><p>""Decide what impressions one's words are likely to make on another person. This last effort of the mind cuts out all stale or mixed images, all prefabricated phrases, needless repetitions, and humbug and vagueness generally.""</p><p>Orwell's 4th rule for writing effectively is clear on this point: ""Never use the passivewhere you can use the active."" Job seekers often resort to passive voice in order to avoid overuse of sentences that begin with ""I"" because that is another resume tip candidates will often hear. While there are times when passive voice can be valuable, it is good to know how the passive voice sounds in context and why it is in your best interest to avoid the passive voice in resumes and cover letters.</p> <h3>Turning Passive into Active </h3> <p>Passive voice means that the writer has moved the direct object or predicate nominative to the front of the sentence. As a result, the verb becomes compounded and the subject of the sentence is moved to an adverbial phrase in the end or is completely erased. ""I did it,"" is active. ""It was done by me,"" is passive. Let's take a look at a few common passive constructions and how active voice improves them.</p> <p><b>Passive:</b> 20 percent revenue growth was realized in our department over two years.</p> <p><b>Active:</b> My team realized 20 percent revenue growth over two years.</p> <p><b>Passive:</b> A promotion to Supervisor was awarded to me after only one year of service.</p> <p><b>Active:</b> After only one year, I earned a promotion to Supervisor.</p> <p><b>Passive:</b> Responsibility was recognized as one of my strengths.</p> <p><b>Active:</b> I am responsible.</p> <p>Passive voice eliminates or downplays the agency of the action. In your resume and cover letter, you don't want to come across as a spectator to your own career. Make sure you are inclusive about who helped you with phrases like ""my team,"" or ""our department"" but be sure to take credit for your best qualities and what you have accomplished.</p> <h3>When Passive is Good</h3> <p>The time when passive voice may be appropriate is when you want to draw attention to the result instead of you. Perhaps you want to make a point but your contribution to the accomplishment was not clear, as in:</p> <p>""All departmental sales goals were exceeded during my tenure there.""</p> <p>Another good reason to use passive voice is when the subject of the sentence is so complex that an active construction would lessen the impact. For example:</p> <p>""Over $50 million in audited savings were recognized by the accounting department in the first year alone due to a variety of employee suggestions that I implemented.""</p><p>The third case is where you or your accomplishments are the direct object of the sentence and the subject doesn't really matter, e.g.:</p><p>""My designs were awarded the top prize for three years in a row.""</p> <h3>Passive vs. Implied</h3><p>You will hear many conflicting resume tips, but<a href=""http://www.gse.harvard.edu/about/administration/careers/documents/Resumes.pdf"">resume advice</a> sites routinely stress the importance of using active voice. The Harvard Graduate School of Education, for example, puts itsuccinctly:</p><blockquote>""Describe your accomplishments in simple but powerful statements in active voice that emphasize the benefit to your<br>employer.""</blockquote><div title=""Page 2""><div><div><ul> </ul> </div> </div> </div><p>Make sure you understand the difference because some career sites confuse the term ""passive voice"" with ""implied subject."" Sentences that start with a verb like ""Managed a team..."" imply the subject ""I"" but are sometimes erroneously called passive constructions. These are perfectly acceptable, especially in bullet points. Just remember this: if whatever is at the start of your sentence is not the one doing the action, but the one that the action is being done to, that's a passive voice construction. It is a stiff, convoluted style that makes your resume or cover letter instantly forgettable. So find the action and the actors, switch around the order and prove to your new employer how active you really are.</p> <p><b>More info about passive voice:</b></p> <p><a href=""http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/passive-voice/"">Passive Voice, The Writing Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/bigdoc/fullbigdoc.pdf"">Use Active Voice, Federal Plain Language Guidelines, The Plain Language Action and Information Network</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.aie.org/finding-a-career/writing-your-resume/100-great-resume-words.cfm"">Use action words and active voice in your resume to help grab the reader's attention, Adventures in Education</a></p><p><a href=""on http://www.gse.harvard.edu/about/administration/careers/documents/Resumes.pdf"">Career Services Office Quick Tips, Harvard Graduate School of Education</a></p>"Resumes,Resume Tips: Action Words,"<h1>Resume Tip: Action Words</h1><p>Action words grab the readers attention. While some might assume strong action words are best suited for fiction, that isn't the case. Strong and straightforward verbs are also preferred when writing a resume.</p><p></p><p>A good resume is concise and streamlined. Every word counts. According to the <a href=""http://www.sjsu.edu/writingcenter/writingresources/handouts/Resume%20Action%20Words.pdf"">San Jose State University Writing Center,</a> you make a resume concise by choosing verbs that carry meaning. Writing a resume with filler and extraneous fluff is not going to win over a potential employer. Here's a list of <a href=""http://careercenter.umich.edu/article/resume-action-words"">action words</a> job seekers should include in their resumes. </p><p></p><p></p><ol><li>The purpose of action words is to show, not tell, potential employers about your past work history. These verbs show employers what actions youve taken at other places of employment. For example, if you created or started something at a previous job, then highlight that accomplishment with action words like <b>designed</b>, <b>generated</b>or <b>launched</b>.<br></li><li>There are numerous action words to choose from. However, you should use the high impact verb that best underscores your skills and accomplishments. Heres a possible scenario. If you were an assistant in a previous job, then you might want to use actions words such as<b>advised</b>, <b>facilitated</b>or <b>notified</b> when you write your resume. If your work consisted of evaluating (a person, place, or thing), action words such as <b>analyzed</b>, <b>estimated</b>and<b> assessed</b> are appropriate. <br></li><li>Action words such as<b>achieved</b>, <b>acquired</b>, <b>expanded</b>, <b>guided</b>and <b>collaborated</b> all enable you to zero in on your strengths and achievements.<br></li><li>If your previous job consisted of ""putting together events at the office,"" then replace ""putting together"" with actions words such as <b>organized</b>, <b>prepared</b>, <b>planned</b>or<b> established</b>.<br></li></ol><h3>Overkill</h3><div>Beware of action verb overkill. While you want to grab the readers attention with clear, strong language, you don't want the resume to become saturated with action words. Balance all that action with facts and substance. If a hiring manager sees too many actions words on a one-page resume, it might be a red flag that you don't have the right credentials or qualifications for the job. Too many buzzwords don't make up for a lack of experience. Choose wisely. <br><h3><b>Action verbs vs. keywords</b></h3></div><div>Many resumes are scanned by software. When writing an electronic resume, remember that the scanner is programmed to pick up keywords. Often the verbs that computers are looking for are included in the job listing. Tailor and match your action verbs to those keywords.</div><h3>Don't Repeat</h3><div>Whatever <a href=""http://www.sjsu.edu/writingcenter/writingresources/handouts/Resume%20Action%20Words.pdf"">action words</a> you use to underline your skills, don't use them repetitively. Mix up the language and wording. For example, if<b> supervised</b> has been used, follow it up later with<b> managed</b>. These words are similar as both illustrate you were in charge of something, but they are different enough not to make your resume sound repetitive. At the same time, steer clear of using any 10-dollar verbs that sound pretentious.</div><a></a><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>While a professional resume will never grab a readers attention like a good thriller, action words lift your skills and credentials off the page.

Who doesn't dream of trying out new foods and drinks on a regular basis and getting paid for their opinion? To be hired as a taste tester in the food industry, you don't need a university degree or specific training; however, if you do have the right education or training, you will go to the top of the resume pile. Careers in this industry are highly coveted.</p><p> All food and beverage testing facilities need testers to ensure not only that their products are palatable, but that they are consistent. According to <a href=""http://www.today.com/food/truth-about-being-taste-tester-its-not-always-tasty-1C8427211"">Today Food</a>, developing a finely-tuned palette that is capable of discerning the slight differences from one batch of coffee-flavored ice cream to the next is important for would-be professional taste testers. Such a palette and the ability to communicate easily with product developers are the most important qualities of a taste tester. Specific qualifications vary between employers, but there are a few characteristics that will appeal to employers looking for food and beverage testers.</p><p></p><h3><b>Top Qualifications of a Taste Tester</b></h3><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Food service experience<br></li><li>Food science degree<br></li><li>Strong sensory abilities</li><li>Flexible schedule<br></li><li>Detail-oriented<br></li><li>Outgoing personality<br></li></ul><p></p><p>Experience as a cook, a chef or even a waiter can make you more appealing to food industry employers because they will know you have certain knowledge of the way food is prepared. In addition to these qualifications, education in food science is a bonus for anyone looking for careers in taste-testing.</p><p>Food science courses teach you about the biology of natural foods as well as the chemical properties of natural and processed foods. Armed with this knowledge, educated job applicants are more likely to be hired as food testers because they will already understand key concepts. However, they will still be tested for their sensory ability, which is a crucial qualification of the job.</p><h3><b>On-Site Training</b></h3><p></p><p>Being hired as a taste tester is not contingent on holding a degree. What matters is a passion and drive to succeed, as well as a finely-tuned sensory ability. If an applicant has those, they stand a good chance of finding a job testing food and beverages. In many cases, employers will pick applicants that best meet their job requirements and offer them on-site training.</p><h3><b>Taste-Testing Testimony</b></h3><p> <a href=""http://flavorman.com/the-perks-and-quirks-of-a-professional-taste-tester/"">Kristen Wemer</a> is a professional taste tester who started working in the industry during college. ""Ive been able to parlay my passion for flavors into a career where companies actually pay me money to taste and evaluate various items.<em>Think dream job!</em>I began as an intern tasting oils. Next, I climbed a level in the food pyramid to a stint tasting milk in the quality lab of a dairy. Ok, so dream job is relevant, but it gets better.""</p><p>Wemer started small and worked her way into a full-time position tasting various types of products as part of quality control. She loves her job, but says there are some days she will never forget when a poor-quality product touched her taste buds. Despite the drawbacks of testing products that should never see a grocery store shelf, Wemer finds her job stimulating and in tune with her creativity and culinary appetite.<br></p><h3><b>Salary of a Taste Tester</b></h3><p>Training programs for these careers will likely be paid, and afterwards result in part or half-time employment as is needed by the company. Because the senses become fatigued, a taste tester generally works no more than two hours at a time. <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/01/13/professional-tasters-eat-and-drink-for-living/"">Fox News</a> reports that entry-level taste testers make between $30,000 and $60,000 a year. Not bad for a job that involves eating!</p>"Job Search Tips,How to Keep Your Job Search Secret,"<h1><b>5 Tips for Keeping Your Job Search Secret from Your Boss</b></h1> <p>The best time to look for a job is when you already have one, but keeping your job search a secret can be a tricky endeavor. Here are five tips for ensuring your current employer is none the wiser until you give your two weeks notice.</p> <h3><b>Radio Silence on Social Media</b></h3> <p>Avoid talking about your search on any of your social networking sites, even those that are (seemingly) private. If a friend on Facebook comments on your post, people in their network, even those who are not friends with you, can see that update. Of course, that doesn't mean you can't use social media at all in your search. As Fauzia Burke outlined in the Huffington Post, there are still plenty of<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fauzia-burke/linkedin-tips_b_2238000.html"">ways to be effective on LinkedIn</a>. Just go to ""Privacy & Settings,"" click on ""Turn on/off your activity broadcasts,"" and make sure the box is unchecked. That way, none of your connections, including coworkers, will see updates or changes to your profile in their feeds.</p> <h3><b>Only on Your Own Time</b></h3> <p>It might go without saying, but it needs to be said: don't job search on your current company's time. Not only is it risky, but it's disrespectful. Not concerned that your current company will care? Potential employers might, and they're wary of candidates who use company resources while applying for positions. It looks inappropriate and unprofessional from the outside and will call your integrity into question.</p> <h3><b>Don't Call Off Sick</b></h3> <p>Continually calling off sick looks suspicious and will also have the adverse effect of making you look unreliable in your current position. Whenever possible, do your best to schedule interviews in your off-work hours, or request time off if necessary. It makes your absence look more official and less like you're being irresponsible.</p> <h3><b>Dress Normally</b></h3> <p>If you have you an interview scheduled after work, don't dress any differently. Coming to work in a suit when you usually wear casual clothes is a clear sign that you're on the job hunt. As<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/10/26/the-dos-and-donts-of-job-searching-while-youre-still-employed/2/"">Andy Teach suggests over at Forbes</a>, bring your interview clothes with you, but keep them in your car. Don't drive to work? Take your suit to a dry cleaner nearby several days prior (a clean suit certainly can't hurt your chances), and give yourself time to pick it up and change before the interview.</p> <h3><b>Avoid Lying Whenever Possible</b></h3> <p>Don't make up stories about absences or your changed behavior at work. Just quietly ask for the time off, and avoid providing any details regarding the request. It's all right to tell a suspicious manager that you're just ""attending to a personal issue"" or taking a ""personal day,"" as<a href=""http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/03/how-to-keep-a-job-search-discr/"">Amy Gallo at the Harvard Business Review suggests</a>. As long as your employer doesn't ask you directly whether you're job searching, vague responses are an acceptable way to maintain secrecy without making you a liar.</p> <h3><b>Bonus Tip: Leave on Good Terms</b></h3> <p>No matter how you feel about your current situation, you always want to leave a job on the best possible terms. Keeping your job search secret may feel disingenuous, but broadcasting your intention to leave is worse. Quietly going about your job hunt is more respectful, as well as giving at least two weeks notice. Maintain good relationships at your current company at all costs, if only so you'll have reliable references in a future job search.</p> <p></p>"Career,How to Take Control of a Job Interview,"<div><div><div><h1>How to Take Control of a Job Interview</h1></div></div></div><p>Experienced interviewers often throw out trick questions that are designed to expose a candidate's weaknesses. Inexperienced interviewers may get lost in minutiae or ask inappropriate questions. No matter what is thrown at you, you need to be prepared to handle the situation. The goal is to leave the impression that you are qualified and excited about the job prospect. Here are some simple tips and tricks to help you keep an interview on track while avoiding the pitfalls of poorly worded and tricky questions.</p><h3><b>Grab the Conversational Ball</b></h3><p>Start the interview with an offer to walk through your resume with the interviewer. This allows you to immediately take control of the conversation and show off your most important attributes. Talk up your skills and successes while avoiding some of your skills gaps.</p><h3><b>Turn the Tables</b></h3><p>Keep in mind that an interview is not just about landing a job offer; it is about deciding whether or not you want the job. Instead of letting the interviewer bog you down with questions about what you expect from the job opportunity, ask him or her what they enjoy about working there. Find out the ins and outs of how the company operates and judge whether or not the corporate culture will be a good fit.</p><h3><b>Master the Polite Cut-In</b></h3><p>As <a href=""http://careers.theguardian.com/live-q-and-a/discuss/094e2739-16fa-4cd2-96f5-25d88d1043c2"">Denise Taylor</a> mentioned in a <a href=""http://careers.theguardian.com/careers-blog/taking-control-in-the-interview"">Live Q&A</a> about how to succeed at an interview, wait for the interviewer to take a breath and cut in with a comment about responding to what they have already said. A polite interruption and careful use of body language can help you regain control of the conversation.</p><h3><b>Minimize Your Feelings of Intimidation</b></h3><p>A <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/10/17/9-lessons-for-job-seekers-and-recruiters-that-might-surprise-you/"">recent survey</a> showed that 38 percent of employers require applicants to interview with a C-level executive. This means you could be facing the CEO, COO, CFO or other major corporate player. Do not get nervous. Treat these interviewers the same way you would anyone else. The only difference is they are often more focused on getting through the interview as quickly as possible, making it crucial for you to takeand keepcontrol of the interview process.</p><h3><b>Prepare Questions Ahead of Time</b></h3><p>According to <a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/news-wire/2013/10/18/5-tricks-to-dominate-an-interview.html"">Dana Manciagli</a>, a contributing writer for The Business Journal, one of the biggest mistakes many applicants make is failing to ask the right, or any, questions. If you have a list of thoughtful questions that show insight into the company, you have a leg up. Not only will it make a better impression on the interviewer, but it also gives you opportunities to control the flow of the conversation.</p><h3><b>Avoid Looking Unprepared</b></h3><p>Answer questions as completely and personally as possible. An anecdote drawn from your work history demonstrating command of a desired skill can impress the questioner. If you do not know the answer or if the question is inappropriate, do not be afraid to ask for clarification. For example, if an interviewer is asking how you'd deal with a hypothetical problem that could occur in the role you're interviewing for, they likely want to hear about how you've handled a similar problem in a past position. Clarify what they are trying to find without being drawn in by the question.</p><p>When you control the flow of the interview, you increase the opportunity to make a good impression. Active and engaged communication shows how interested you are, and preparation displays your ability to anticipate and respond accordingly. Do not let the job interview drag on in a long discussion of your shortcomings. Instead, draw the interviewer into a positive discussion of your successes and lessons learned.</p>"Job Search Tips,How to Lose Control of a Job Interview,"<h1>How to Lose Control of a Job Interview</h1><p>You can't control a job interview completely, but you can help guide it on track and keep the interviewer's focus on your skills and experience. In order to help you avoid losing control of a job interview, we're going to advise you on how to lose control of a job interview. Think of it like a brainstorm meeting in which you're asked to list as many bad ideas as possible. Once those bad ideas are dispensed with you can focus in on the good ones.</p><h3><b>Bring Your Distractions and Stress</b></h3><p>When you come into a <a href=""http://mashable.com/2011/11/20/job-interview-tips/"">job interview </a>feeling deep stress, or in a bad mood, or you feel overwhelmed by life, you are unable to be present in the moment the way you need to be. You won't keep your entire focus on the interview as your thoughts drift to your problems. This makes it harder to truly connect with the interviewer in a way that makes them feel like you could be part of their company.</p><h3><b>Don't Ask Questions</b></h3><p>When you walk into the<a href=""http://www.job.com/interview/""> interview room</a>, the interviewer isn't the only one who should be asking questions. If you only respond to the interviewer instead of asking questions of your own, you don't show any initiative or curiousity. If a question occurs to you during the interview, ask it. It shows you are paying attention. And when the interviewer asks, ""Do you have any questions?""--and they almost always do--have some questions prepared.</p><h3><b>Have a Self-Defeating Attitude</b></h3><p>Avoid feelings of self-deprecation and sharing those feelings of self-deprecation. You're there to sell yourself, not humble yourself. When you walk into the interview room assuming that you aren't going to get the job, or in awe of just being there, it sets the tone for the rest of the interview in a bad way. Be proud and confident. They called you in for a reason. You're qualified to do this job.</p><h3><b>Don't Research the Company</b></h3><p>Interviewers want to see that you checked up on their company before the interview. Do your research. Read the website. Scour news articles, Look at their social media channels. These things will clue you in on what the company values, and when you know what the company does and how it sees itself, you can sell them on where you fit in.</p><h3><b>Have a Negative Public Image</b></h3><p>While you might not agree with the practice, the reality is that many interviewers are going to type your name into Google and judge you by what they find online and on your social media channels. You don't want to be seen constantly partying, taking drugs or doing other activities that might not reflect well on the business. Check your privacy settings and remove any content you would not want your boss to see. Job seekers would be shocked to learn how often not taking this step knocks them out of contention for a job.<br><br></p><div><br></div>"Career,Careers: The No. 1 Predictor of Success is Intelligence,"<h1>Study: The No. 1 Predictor of Success is Intelligence</h1><p>As students we're taught that if we work hard and persevere, we can achieve our dreams. Careers in space engineering, Wall Street or the White House are all possible, so long as you are willing to put in the time and effort. As you get older, you start to question this ethos. What about natural intelligence, socioeconomic status and nepotism? Surely these factors have a bearing on achievement and career success, right? You've heard the old saying, ""It's not what you know, it's who you know.""<br></p><p><a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120329142035.htm"">Recent research</a> conducted by Professor Yoav Ganzach of Tel Aviv University's Recanati School of Management suggests that intelligence really is the most important factor when it comes to success. Ganzach says that ""when intelligence and socio-economic background are pitted directly against one another, intelligence is a more accurate predictor of future career success."" Ganzach's research shows that despite one's financial background, the people who move up the career ladder more quickly are those with the higher recorded intelligence.</p><h3>How is Intelligence Measured?</h3><p>The traditional method of calculating one's intelligence is the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) test. These standardized tests produce results that are considered highly reliable by most professional psychology practitioners. Despite the general acceptance of IQ scores, scientists and researchers also question whether emotional and environmental factors are a significant part of human intelligence as well.</p><p>Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a relatively new scientific perspective on intelligence, which Ganzach did not include in his study. The EI theory states that the ability of a person to identify and control his or her emotions is an important form of intelligence. Certainly in terms of careers, people more in control of their emotional responses will face significantly fewer social hardships on a daily basis.</p><p>Many modern researchers agree that there are <a href=""http://infed.org/mobi/howard-gardner-multiple-intelligences-and-education/"">four types of human intelligence</a>, all of which are necessary to be successful at work and at home: Moral Intelligence, Body Intelligence, Emotional Intelligence and the classic IQ score.</p><h3>IQ and Career Success</h3><p>The subjects of Ganzach's study were initially differentiated by their socioeconomic status during the first years of their careers. When a university education is taken out of the equation, it is the people with the most financially well-off families that find entry-level careers with the highest salaries. Over the subsequent years, however, the employees who were recorded with the higher IQ levels were the ones who advanced more quickly through their respective industry ranks. <br></p><p>The employees more likely to be offered a raise or a promotion during their careers, therefore, are those with higher levels of intelligence. According to<i> </i><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/keldjensen/2012/04/12/intelligence-is-overrated-what-you-really-need-to-succeed/"">Forbes</a><i>, ""</i>IQ tests are used as an indicator of logical reasoning ability and technical intelligence. A high IQ is often a prerequisite for rising to the top ranks of business today.""</p><p>Turns out, it is what you know.<br></p>"Career,Careers: What Makes a Job Good,"<p></p><div><div><h1>What Makes a Job Good?</h1><p></p></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><p></p><p>Overall job satisfaction is down, according to the most <a href=""http://www.shrm.org/Research/SurveyFindings/Articles/Documents/SHRM-Employee-Job-Satisfaction-Engagement-Executive-Summary.pdf"">recent survey</a> by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM). However, about 81 percent of respondents report that they are satisfied with their current jobs. When you are looking into possible careers, it's important to know what factors make a job a good job. While a positive work environment and respect from colleagues helps, there are five bigger factors that influence job satisfaction.</p> <h3><b>1. Opportunities to use skills and abilities</b></h3><p></p> <p>The top factor in job satisfaction is employees use of skills and abilities. People want jobs that allow them to feel that they are accomplishing personal and professional goals and contributing to the company. Employees also want the opportunity for promotions and more responsibility. Look for jobs that allow you to use <a href=""http://smallbusiness.chron.com/factors-affecting-job-satisfaction-20114.html"">your favorite skills</a>. Many companies are willing to promote from within if employees develop advanced skills. Companies often pay all or part of tuition for training.</p> <h3><b>2. Job security</b></h3><p></p> <p>Although job security is listed as the second most important factor for job satisfaction, more employees realize that this is not always possible. While some job hunters might gravitate toward careers that they think have more security, no industry or career is immune to a bad economy. Experts suggest that you look for a job in a field you really like instead. </p> <h3><b>3. Compensation</b></h3><p></p> <p>Employees want a fair wage for the duties they perform. It also helps if the company presents clear guidelines about the relationship between salary increases and job performance. Employees are also more satisfied with pay if they have opportunities to earn incentives, such as bonuses. <a href=""http://smallbusiness.chron.com/factors-affecting-job-satisfaction-20114.html"">Regular salary increases</a> based on performance can also help improve job satisfaction.</p> <h3><b>4. Communication between employees and senior management</b></h3><p></p> <p>Companies that <a href=""http://www.inc.com/magazine/20100501/guidebook-how-to-communicate-with-employees.html"">communicate with employees</a> on a regular basis help with job satisfaction. It's important for employees to be updated on what is happening in the company. This prevents rumors that cause stress and distractionsfrom circulating. A good workplace keeps employees informed about all of the important matters that affect a company's financial health. There are several websites that allow employees to give feedback about a company, which is useful information for a job seeker.</p> <h3><b>5. Relationship with immediate supervisor</b></h3><p></p> <p>The relationship between an employee and his immediate supervisor has to be one that involves communication. A good manager recognizes and praises his staff. The manager must also make it clear that he or she is always available if the employee wants to discuss any work-related issues.</p><p>People still want to enjoy their jobs, especially with so many employees working at least a 40-hour week. While there are no careers that provide job satisfaction for all employees, you can improve your odds by looking for a job that gets you excited. For some people, any job will do, but most people want to find a good job that offers much more than a paycheck.</p><p><br></p><br>"Job Search Tips,Jobs for Introverts,"<h1>Jobs for Introverts</h1><p>If you prefer to spend time alone rather than in social situations, you might be an introvert. This means you regain your energy by having time for yourself, rather than being around people. Not surprisingly, introverts do their best with certain types of jobs. In particular, <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/career-transitions/201005/the-shy-job-seeker"">Psychology Today</a>notes that the strengths of introverts tend to include listening, observing, writing, making decisions carefully and building deep relationships with a select few. The following six positions are considered ideal jobs for introverts.<br></p> <h3>1. Criminology <br></h3> <p><a href=""http://www.floridatechonline.com/online-degree-resources/eight-career-paths-for-introverts/"">Florida Tech University Online</a>recommends criminology as a career for introverts because it requires superior observation skills. You can expect to collect and analyze a variety of information in this position. For example, you will study criminal behavior and write reports, which are two skills that many introverts possess. If you have always been intrigued by the way criminals work, and you prefer to work alone for most your day, this career may suit you. <br></p> <h3>2. Writing <br></h3> <p><a href=""http://work.chron.com/top-careers-introverts-5365.html"">The Houston Chronicle</a>suggests that introverts take up writing as a career. This is because much writing does not depend on interaction with other people throughout the day. In fact, when it comes to copy writing, for example, it's often just you and your computer. If you are creative, you can become an author of fiction books or poems. If you prefer to research and report facts, nonfiction writing might suit you better, although you will need some people skills when interviewing. Either way, you will likely be left to your own devices for most of the workday, except for occasional emails or meetings with your editors or sources. <br></p> <h3>3. Accounting <br></h3> <p>Accountants spend most of their work hours with numbers, not other people. If you're an introvert who happens to be organized and good at math, accounting may be the right job. Most of your day will likely be spent looking at financial records and preparing tax returns. Since shockingly few people like to stick around and watch people do math, you can expect to do the job alone most of the time. Client meetings are an exception.<br></p> <h3>4. Medical Records Technician <br></h3> <p>As you might have guessed, this career involves dealing with records. It's a nice gig for organized employees who prefer to work in the background, not at the front desk. If you want to be involved in the healthcare industry without having to interact with patients on a regular basis, consider becoming a medical records technician. As a bonus, the medical field is growing. <br></p> <h3>5. Engineering <br></h3> <p>Engineering is ideal for introverts looking for a job that pays well without requiring constant contact with other people. The specialties within this career vary, giving you lots of options that include civil, software, chemical and industrial engineering. Depending on the exact position you choose, you will be left to your own devices most of the day while you work, with the occasional team meeting or field site visit required. <br></p> <h3>6. Software Developer<br></h3> <p>A software developer position is another job that is ideal for introverts. This makes sense because this position involves sitting at a computer in an office or even at home, spending hours creating new software of all kinds. This is where making thoughtful decisions comes into play, since you will have to carefully evaluate the software you create and then solve any problems you find. It is not unusual for software developers to mostly communicate with coworkers and clients by email or chat, and only when necessary. So if you enjoy both solitude, problem-solving and technology, this career may be right for you. </p><p>All of the careers on our jobs for introverts list have one very important thing in common: they allow people to work the majority of time on their own, and as shown, there are many high quality career choices for introverts to choose from. This list is by no means complete, so don't let it limit your choices. Instead, use it as a guide to help you consider what types of jobs fit with your personality type.</p>"Interviews,Job Search Advice from 7 Experts,"<p></p><h1>Job Search Advice from 7 Experts</h1><p>During your job search you have undoubtedly received well-intended advice from many sources. Everyone and their brother has an opinion, so make sure the people you listen to are actually qualified to help you during your job hunt.

Resist the urge to send the same resume to multiple job listings. In fact, many companies use software to scan resumes for keywords that relate to the position, so be sure to include keywords that make sense for each individual job posting.<br></p> <h3><b>Strategic vs. Casting the Widest Net Possible </b></h3> <p>During your job hunt, heed the advice of Jacqui Barrett-Poindexter, who is a master resume writer, <a href=""http://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm"">Glassdoor</a> career and workplace expertand career writer for CareerTrend.

Focus on applying to jobs that would fit you well rather than responding to every job ad you see.<em><br></em></p> <h3><b>Use Social Media to Your Advantage </b></h3> <p>You might have heard how social media can hurt you during the job search, but the opposite can be true if you use social media correctly. Jonathan Nafarrete, director of social outreach at BLITZ Agency, told <a href=""http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/3082-social-media-job-hunting.html"">Business News Daily</a>, ""Employers love to see individuals with a professional onlineresumepresence."" He advises job searchers to update their profiles and share industry-related content on sites such as LinkedIn and Twitter, in particular. <br></p> <h3><b>Use LinkedIn Carefully for a Career Change </b></h3> <p><a href=""http://www.lindseypollak.com/archives/the-stealth-job-search-how-to-job-hunt-privately-on-linkedin?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+LindseyPollak+%28Lindsey+Pollak+Career+Blog%29"">Lindsey Pollak</a> is a bestselling author and keynote speaker who also happens to be an expert on managing and marketing. Her advice is helpful if you already have a job and don't want your employer to know you are looking for a new one. She says that LinkedIn is a helpful resource that is also discreet as long as you change your settings to hide your activity updates and keep your profile private when you view profiles during your job search. <br></p> <h3><b>Show How Well You Can Fit in with the Company </b></h3> <p>According to author and assistant professor at Northwesterns Kellogg School of Management<a href=""http://www.theglasshammer.com/news/2013/10/08/fitting-in-what-interviewers-are-really-looking-for/"">Lauren A. Rivera</a>,many interviewers focus more on the ability to fit in than skills. She says that the personal interests section of your resume is the first clue you give to employers as to whether you'll fit in or not. Rivera adds that for the best results, you should list a wide range of personal interests and mention them when the interviewer asks you to tell him or her about yourself. </p> <h3><b>Make Time in Your Schedule to Network </b></h3> <p>Tory Johnson, CEO of <a href=""http://womenforhire.com/beginning_your_job_search/positive_energy_and_self_promotion/"">Women for Hire</a>, says thatmany of her job search tips revolve around staying energized rather than falling into bad habits during the job hunt. She advises job seekers to stick to a regular schedule instead of sleeping in and devoting at least three hours per day to the job search. She urges them to continue to socialize, since networking is so important when looking for a job.<br></p> <h3><b>Use Creativity to Make Your Resume Stand Out </b></h3> <p>Vice president of human resources at CareerBuilderRosemary Haefner told <a href=""http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2845-resume-tips.html"">Business News Daily</a> that many HR managers spend less than one minute looking at resumes. That's why her bit of job search advice is to use visuals, infographics, QR codes and other attention-grabbing tactics to increase the likelihood of your resume being read.</p>"Career,What 'Average is Over' Means for You,"<h2>What Does 'Average Is Over' Mean for You?</h2><p>According to American economist Dr. Tyler Cowen, <a href=""http://stream.wsj.com/story/latest-headlines/SS-2-63399/SS-2-343190/"">""Average Is Over""</a> means that the American economy will not return to the good old, days, change is coming for American workers, machines will play a more important role in our lives and were going to see an increase in income inequality. Now, dont panic. According to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Average-Is-Over-Powering-Stagnation/dp/0525953736"">Cowen's new book of the same name</a>, all is not as dire as it seems.</p><h3>Understanding Cowens claims</h3><p>Cowen's assertions in ""Average is Over"" are:<br></p><ul><li>We are seeing the erosion of the old American economy and the start of something new.</li><li>The rich are going to get richer, and we wont have much of a middle class buffer.</li><li>Workers need to become better complements to machines in order to remain economically valuable.</li><li>Education for the elite will stay on its current track, while education for others who are self-motivated will follow a new, less expensive model.</li><li>Meritocracy will emerge over old networks.</li></ul><h3>Disputing Cowens conclusions</h3><p>Somebody was bound to say the economy is changing. Of all the people who could have, Dr. Cowen has the credibility to make the case for what our futures look like. However, its important to realize that the economy is full of unforeseen trends. While the trends Cowen examines are possible, there is no guarantee they will come to pass.</p><p><a href=""http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/09/tyler_cowen_on.html"">Russ Roberts of EconTalk</a>, for example, is skeptical of Cowens conclusions. Roberts thinks Cowens claims are based on projecting distorted data into the future, which results in distorted conclusions.</p><p>Furthermore, there are other trends that run counter to the ones Cowen discusses in his book. Corporate social responsibility and increasing entrepreneurship among recent college graduates are just two primary examples. Cowen doesnt seem to account for these economic forces in projecting the future.</p><h3>Preparing for Cowens economy</h3><p>Lets say that Cowen is right and the trends he cites become dominant in our economy. Does this mean that the future he predicts is inevitable?</p><p>You, like so many other empowered American workers, can still take hold of your own destiny. The key to your economic viability is not to settle for being average. Whether that means you make it to the top 15 percent of all earners or not, striving will give you a competitive edge when shaping your economic future.</p><p>Heres what you can do to prepare for the future envisioned in ""Average is Over"":</p><ul><li>Become self-motivated.<br></li><li>Become a master of the technology you use.<br></li><li>Seek out opportunities to work cooperatively with technology.<br></li><li>Become an effective interpreter of human behavior.<br></li><li>Become your own tech support by keeping up with current technologies.<br></li><li>Seek out educational opportunities that are encouraging and effective.<br></li></ul><p>Embracing the entrepreneurial spirit of trial and discovery no matter where you work will help you combine these elements and use them to propel your own economic future.</p><p><a></a>Cowens claims in ""Average Is Over"" are dire--for the unmotivated. The future he envisions is not inevitable for all. You dont have to be the victim of economic trends. You can become the power that drives your own economic future, whether Cowen is right or wrong.</p><p></p>"Resumes,Holiday Job Search,"<h1>How to Conduct a Holiday Job Search</h1><p>The trick to landing a good seasonal job is to approach a holiday job search with just as much dedication and professionalism as you would apply to searching for a full-time position. Here are a few tips that can help you get started on your holiday job search.</p><h3>Find out who is hiring</h3><p>It is never too early to start your holiday job search. Ask around in local establishments to find out whether they are planning to take on extra holiday staff. Employers are likely to respond well to your eager approach, as it demonstrates enthusiasm and commitment.</p><p>An obvious place to start your holiday job search is the retail sector, which is busy in the run-up to Christmas. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2012/10/25/how-to-get-a-holiday-job-2/"">In 2012, Macy's recruited around 80,000 seasonal workers</a> to cope with the holiday rush. If you don't have retail experience, there are plenty of alternatives, such as processing and delivery jobs, bar work and waiting tables during the busy holiday period.</p><p>Some <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/jobs/21career.html?_r=0"">seasonal opportunities</a> that you might not have thought about before include tech support jobs to maintain websites during the holiday shopping season, part-time positions in the security industry and temporary roles in accounting firms as companies race towards the end of the year.</p><h3>Look into perks and discounts</h3><div>There are many reasons why you might want a holiday job, but staff discounts are a major draw. Macy's offers <a href=""http://www.macysjobs.com/Benefits/OurGratitude"">20 percent off most merchandise</a> to all workers, even those who are only part of the team for the holiday season. That can be pretty useful when buying holiday presents. Many other large employers also offer staff discounts or other perks such as free food and drink.</div><h3>Search efficiently for holiday jobs</h3><p>Online job boards can be a fantastic place to search for holiday jobs. Companies use sites such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> to quickly recruit large numbers of workers to meet the increased holiday demands on their business. Check the boards regularly for new opportunities and set up email alerts.</p><p>When looking for seasonal jobs online, remember to search for keywords such as ""holiday,"" ""seasonal,"" and ""Christmas."" Including these terms in your online holiday job search can help narrow your search results to seasonal jobs only.</p><h3>Tailor your resume</h3><p>Tailor your resume to support your holiday job application, particularly if you are applying for a role outside of your usual field. List all experience that is relevant to the desired position, including volunteer work or community activities. Unlike the resume you use when applying for full-time positions, the ideal resume for your holiday job will focus less on your overall career goals and more on demonstrating your reliability, teamwork and ability to adapt quickly to new situationsall key skills for succeeding in a seasonal role.</p><h3>Tips for holiday job interviews</h3><div><ul><li><b>Show enthusiasm</b>. Employers want to know that you are keen to work hard and help the company deliver holiday cheer to its customers, particularly if you are in a public role.</li><li><b>Be professional</b>. Don't make the mistake of thinking that seasonal roles require a lower standard of professionalism than full-time positions. Get to the interview on time and dress smart to make a good impression.</li><li><b>Be flexible</b>. Flexibility is a key quality that seasonal employers need from their workers. Figure out what your schedule will be this holiday season before going to an interview so you can let the company know when you will be available to work.</li><li><b>Do your research</b>. If you're applying for a job with a national retailer, visit your local branch to familiarize yourself with the environment in which you'll be working.</li><li><b>Don't mention perks up front</b>. Try to avoid asking about perks such as staff discounts, at least until the end of the interview, as you don't want to give the impression that you're only interested in the job for the added benefits.</li></ul><h3>Plan for success</h3><p>By following the above tips, you can succeed in your holiday job search.

According to the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/osh/os/osar0009.pdf"">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, there were 9.4 security guard fatalities per 100,000 workers in 2007, which was the most recent year this data was made publicly available. These statistics do fluctuate slightly. For example, 2006 only saw 8.7 fatalities per 100,000 security guards. However, there are consistently higher rates of homicide deaths among security guards than in the average workforce population.</p><p>This shouldnt be surprising considering that organizations hire security guards to protect their workers, their property and their customers. Security guards are hired to face danger. This is why security guards also receive training, equipment and support to help them keep themselves and others safe. Proper training and conscientious performance can reduce the risk of workplace injury or death.</p><h3>The Pay</h3><p>The <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes339032.htm"">median hourly wage for security guards working in the U.S.</a> is $11.52 per hour or $23,970 per year. That can vary, ranging as low as $8.36 per hour or $17,390 per year to as high as $20.43 per hour or $42,490 per year. There are over one million security guards working across the country, and it is viewed as a good job for physically able men and women who are willing to take risks in order to help keep others safe.</p><p></p>"Interviews,How to Project Confidence During a Job Interview,"<h1><b>How to Project Confidence During a Job Interview</b><br></h1><p>A job interview can be a tense, intimidating experience, but there are ways to improve your chances of landing the position. To increase your chances of getting a call-back or an on-the-spot offer, calm your nerves like a Zen master, focus on the task at hand and project confidence.</p><p>How you present yourself, the questions you ask and the manner in which you ask questions go a long way towards determining what sort of impression you will make on a potential employer. If the first five minutes you spend with someone determines how far a relationship goes, then you need to learn how to project confidence during a job interview.<br></p><p></p><h3><b>1. When it comes to appearance, stick to the classics</b></h3><p></p><p>Appearing poised and controlled gives you self-confidence. Take the necessary steps to go above and beyond simply looking good. A job interview isn't the time to gamble on your appearance, so stick to the classics. For example, a no-iron, button-down dress shirt is the type of business attire you should wear, not the Hawaiian shirt you got while on vacation in Cancun. </p><p></p><h3><b>2. Talk slowly and clearly, and get to the point</b></h3><p></p><p>How you answer questions is just as important as what you say. If you are nervous, you may have a tendency to talk too fast. Make a conscious effort to slow down. Long-winded answers not only illustrate nervousness and anxiety, they also demonstrate poor communication skills. Keep your answers succinct and concise.</p><p></p><h3><b>3. Arrogance is not confidence</b></h3><p></p><p>When you're face-to-face with a potential employer, you don't want to come across as arrogant, boastful or pompous. Relay your skills, talents and previous work experiences in a humble and matter-of-fact manner. Gloating about your past achievements or promotions is off-putting. Real confidence does not draw attention to itself. </p><p></p><h3><b>4. Fidgeting draws negative attention, so calm the hands</b></h3><p></p><p>Good body language is key to demonstrating confidence. Fidgeting, touching your face and fiddling with your clothing are nervous tics you need to leave at the door. There's nothing calm, cool or collected about playing with your hair or continually adjusting your tie. So what are you supposed to do to calm your hands? Imagine there's an invisible line (or a sort of mental electric fence) somewhere on your torso, and try to keep your hands below it.</p><p></p><h3><b>5.</b> <b>Do your homework</b></h3><p></p><p><a></a>The more you know about the company or business you're interviewing for, the better you can tailor your answers. This type of knowledge will give you a boost of confidence. The interviewer is going to be impressed that you've taken the time to research the company and its products and services. It shows initiative and hits home the fact you're willing to go the extra mile. </p><p></p><h3><b>6. </b><b>Steer clear of clichs</b></h3><p></p><p>Answering questions on the spot can be nerve-wracking; but the last thing you want is to pepper your responses with a lot of ""likes"" or ""ums."" At the same time, you don't want to fall back on clichs either. Interviewers don't want to hear how you're a team player or a people person. Employers hear those tired phrases at every interview they conduct. Creativity shows confidence, so set yourself apart from other candidates by being original in your responses. </p><p>Ask your friends or family for advice. Any help from others who have been there before can be useful. Follow these six tips and you'll portray the confidence to ace that next job interview.</p>"Resumes,Great Opening Lines from Cover Letters,"<h1><b>Great Opening Lines From Cover Letters</b></h1> <p>If youre in the market for a new job, its time to focus on writing killer opening lines for your cover letters. Hiring employers sift through cover letters when searching for the right candidate, and you want to be one of the few who leaves an impression. Most employers will just scan the first few lines of your cover letter, and if nothing grabs them right away, it's likely they will move on to the next application.</p> <p>Your opening line should be good. It has to show the hiring employer why you are the right person for the job and also keep him or her interested. <a href=""http://careergirlnetwork.com/4-cover-letter-openers-that-score-the-interview/?goback=%2Egde_3135001_member_227615972#%21"">Marcy Twete, author of <i>You Know Everybody! A Career Girls Guide to Building a Network That Works</i></a>, claims that the opener should answer the following questions:</p> <p></p><ul><li>What is amazing about what youve done recently that this company needs?<br></li><li>How do you fit the role better than anyone else?</li><li>Why are you the best fit for the company?</li><li>Do you have the experience and the strengths this job needs? Why?</li></ul><p></p> <p></p> <p>How do you cram all that into the opening sentence or two? Here are a few good examples:</p> <h3>Use Humor, If You're Humorous</h3><p>One cover letter that has gone viral took a humorous andnarcissisticapproach.</p><p>It began:</p><p>""This position is exactly the job I'm looking for! Forget all the other candidates for Aviary, I am the BEST..."" It goes on to describe how awesome the applicant was at everything.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/23/epic-cover-letter_n_865569.html"">This example is pretty extreme</a>, but the point here is to use humor to convey your individuality, sense of humor and personality while remaining professional. Remember, employers read through tons of cover letters and they tend to be a bit boring. If you can write a witty cover letter, it could increase your chances of landing an interview. </p> <h3>Be Confident and Straightforward</h3><p>Ask A Manager presents an<a href=""http://www.askamanager.org/2011/09/great-cover-letter.html"">example of a cover letter</a>that hooks the reader right away. It projects confidence and also piques curiosity. Now the employer will want to read on to find out<i>why</i>you are the best person for the job.</p> <p>""Dear ___,</p> <p>As soon as I saw your posting for a ____, I knew it was the perfect position for me and that I was the perfect solution for you. Let me explain further:""</p><h3>Name Drop</h3> <p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2011/03/24/how-to-write-a-cover-letter/"">Forbes No. 1 piece of advice</a> is to put the name of a mutual contact (if you have one) into the first line to immediately set you apart from all the other applicants. It also suggests making your cover letter into a story by telling an anecdote or connecting the information in a more interesting way than just stating facts.</p><h3>Be Visual: Use a Chart</h3> <p><a href=""http://blog.brazencareerist.com/2013/05/28/5-creative-cover-letters-that-worked/"">Rachel Kaufman</a> suggests opening with a chart listing the companys job requirements on the left of the page and your matching qualifications on the right side. This can be more visually appealing than looking at blocks of paragraphs and will make the letter easier to scan. Start with what you think is the most important requirement or the one about which you feel most confident.</p><p>Whichever tactic you choose, put extra effort into making the opening lines of your cover letter a winner.</p>"Interviews,How to Make an Impression During a Job Interview,"<div><h1>How to Make an Impression During a Job Interview</h1></div><p>Nothing feels better than walking out of a job interview that went well. To nail an interview, you have to cover the basics. You've probably heard most of these before, but it never hurts to review. Soak in these tips to make an impression during your next job interview.</p><h3><b>Time is of the Essence</b></h3><p>Be on time, be on time and be on time again. If you show up even a minute or two late, it will reflect negatively on you, either in the sense that you are not that reliable or didn't see the interview as important. You should plan on being there at least 10 minutes early, so preparing ahead of time will help you make sure this happens. Know exactly where you are going and how long it will take to get there. </p><h3><b>Dress for Success</b></h3><p>You have total control over this step, and you should use that fact to your advantage. Dressing appropriately for the job for which you are interviewing is critical. If you show up extremely under-dressed for the position, they may not take you seriously as a candidate and might think you are not taking the interview seriously.</p><div><h3><b>Be Prepared</b></h3><p>Print out your resume and any other paperwork that you might need for your interview the night before. This will keep you from rushing around at the last minute trying to figure out what you need. Also, you should have an idea of what you want to ask or say to your interviewer. Showing that you have an interest and are knowledgeable about the organization will go a long way. Research the company thoroughly beforehand.</p><h3><b>Use Proper Speech</b></h3><p>Interviewers are trained to feel you out, and they expect you to use proper speech. Lose any slang you normally utilize and only carry your professional language skills in with you. Likewise, try to minimize or eliminate any filler words such as uh and um. It is okay to be nervous, but try your best to impress the interviewer with your communication skills, since they are important for most jobs.</p><h3><b>It Isn't Over 'Til it's Over</b></h3><p>Just because you've stood up from the desk and shook the interviewer's hand doesn't mean the interview process is over. You should keep your cellphone in your pocket until you make it to your car. You will most likely want to share the news about how your interview went, but the right time and place to do that is not on the premises. You never know who will be walking down the hall, riding in the elevator or even sitting outside on break, overhearing everything you have to say. Don't say anything that will ruin all the hard work that went into your job interview.</p></div>"Career,How Many Job Changes in a Career is Normal,"<h1><b>How Many Job Changes in a Career is Normal?</b></h1><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not track job changes, so hard data concerning how many job changes are normal in a career does not exist. However, one of the most repeated claims in recent years is that the average worker will have seven different jobs in his or her lifetime.</p><p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704206804575468162805877990"">How exactly the number seven gained traction remains a mystery</a>. Some job experts and economists claim that such a high number is implausible, but there are workers who have changed jobs that many times or more, so it's not impossible. Millennials are known for changing jobs quite frequently.</p><p>The Millennial generation includes those people born between 1977 and 1997. According to a <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2012/08/14/job-hopping-is-the-new-normal-for-millennials-three-ways-to-prevent-a-human-resource-nightmare/"">survey by Future Workplace</a> entitled ""Multiple Generations at Work,"" 91 percent of Millennials expect to stay at a job for less than three years. With that figure, Millennials will experience about 15 to 20 career changes in a lifetime.To think, job researchers and economists think that<i>seven</i>job changes in a career is considered high.<br></p><h3>Nothing New</h3><p></p><p>It sounds like a new trend, but early and frequent job changes have always been common. Most people do not stay at the same job they had in high school for their entire lives, or remain in their college jobs, and many don't remain at their first post-college, entry-level position for a lifetime.</p><p>Even the Baby Boomers shopped around settling down at a particular position or company. It often takes more than one or two jobs before a person finds solid footing in the workforce. Statistics from the Labor Department, however, suggest the amount of time American adults have spent with the same employer hasnt changed much over the years:</p><p></p><ul><li>In 1996, 9 percent of workers had been with their employer for 20 years or more. In 2008, 10.3 percent of workers had been with the same employer for at least 20 years.</li><li>In 1996, the average workers tenure with his or her current employer was 3.8 years. In 2000, that number had dropped slightly to 3.5 years; but by 2008, it had risen to 4.1 years.</li></ul><p></p><p><a></a>The statistics from 2008 represent the latest available data, so take these stats with a small grain of salt. The workscape changed dramatically with the 2008 recession and its aftermath.</p><p></p><h3><b>What Can You Do to Be Prepared for Job Changes?</b></h3><p></p><p>If job hopping is the norm, then job seekers need to be versatile. Workers must adapt to the changing workforce. It's no longer just a question of going to college to become better prepared for a particular job; it's the realization that you may need to go back to school again, learn a trade or get an alternative certificate later in your career. After all, it's always good to keep one's options open regarding opportunities that may present themselves. Remain flexible and diversified if you feel there are other outlets for you to explore professionally.</p><p></p><p>The American author F. Scott Fitzgerald famously said, ""There are no second acts in American lives."" Not so, F. Scott. Apparently there are seven acts, and what's considered a normal number of job changes in a career is only going to keep changing.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Job Search Tips,Use Loose Connections to Get Your Next Job,"<h2><b>Use Loose Connection to Get Your Next Job</b></h2> <p></p> <p>The conventional way to get a job is to scour job ads, send your resum to employers and wait for a response. But this is not always the most effective way to get a job. Many positions are not advertised or are promised to someone who knows someone. Another way to get a job that requires a little more work but often nets big results is to network with ""loose connections,"" those acquaintances who work in your industry but who are not necessarily close friends. Indeed, <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2011/06/07/networking-is-still-the-best-way-to-find-a-job-survey-says/"">Forbes</a> reports that in 2011 some 41 percent of individuals found their jobs through such networking. </p> <h3><b>Practice Your Small Talk Skills</b></h3> <p>You never know who may be connected to the industry in which you want to work, so its important to be open to meeting people wherever you go. Practice making small talk with people in stores, at parties and on the street. Find out what they do. Tell them what you do and what you are trying to do with your career.</p> <h3><b>Be Specific About What You Want</b></h3> <p>Your loose connections may want to help, but if you aren't specific enough they won't be able to assist you. Be clear about the kind of job you want. In addition to knowing the industry, you should understand:</p> <p></p><ul><li>The position you're seeking<br></li><li>The types of skills you want to use<br></li><li>The salary range you want<br></li></ul><p></p> <p>Once you figure it out, synthesize it into a statement you can make when telling your connections about your job hunt.</p> <h3><b>Mention Your Job Search Naturally</b></h3> <p>When talking to your acquaintances, don't just blurt out that you are looking for work. Let it come up naturally in conversation. For example, mention that you're looking for a job only when your acquaintances ask what you have been up to or when they talk about their jobs. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Meet People Who are Tangentially Related</b></h3> <p>Don't limit your networking efforts to people who are directly connected to the industry you want to work for. You never know who may have the connections you need to get where you want to go. Be open to meeting all sorts of people. The more people you get to know, the more likely you are to meet someone who can let you in on job opportunities or put in a good word for you at a particular company. </p> <h3><b>Ask For References</b></h3> <p>One of the best ways to find a job is to directly contact people who you would like to use as references. Tell these individuals about the kind of job you are looking for and ask them if they would be willing to serve as references. They may have ideas for where to look. Even if they don't, they will be aware you are job hunting, which may start them thinking. It also ensuresthat you will have references when you do apply for jobs.</p><p></p> <p></p> <p>It can be unnerving to talk to connections about jobs, especially if you don't know them that well. Just remember that most people are happy to help. Be confident and kind when talking to loose connections and you will get job leads you otherwise wouldn't know existed.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"Interviews,What to do if you Get Flustered During a Job Interview,"<h1>What to Do if You Get Flustered During a Job Interview</h1><p>Nervous about your job interview? Don't worry. You're not alone. An overwhelming majority of job seekers are. Whether you're under-qualified, overqualified or properly experienced, nerves can strike at any time during a job interview. So what do you do when this happens? Take deep breaths? Recite mantras? Meditate? Not if you want the interview to continue. If you're in a job interview and catch a case of the jitters, here's what you should do.</p><h3>Revert to Conversation Mode</h3><div>Being interviewed can be a little intense. You are asked questions, and those questions are followed up by silence and note-taking. It can seem more like an interrogation and less like a job interview. If you start to feel a bit flustered at this point, think of your interview as an everyday conversation. <i><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45ehgee/think-of-the-interview-as-a-conversation/"">Forbes</a></i> recommends considering the interview as a conversation between yourself and someone you know. Imagine you're getting to know each other better by having a Q&A dialogue.</div><div><br></div><div>Also, remember that you may not be the only one with a case of the heebie-geebies. Interviewing managers might also suffer from performance anxiety and feel a little nervous about having a one-on-one conversation with a person they don't know. If you come across as warm and friendly, the interviewer's body language will change, which can help ease everyone's nerves.</div><h3>Put Your Body in a Relaxed Position</h3><div>Body language can change the dynamics of a conversation. It also changes the way you feel during a nervous situation. If you feel yourself trembling or your muscles tensing, give in. Tense your muscles purposely. Squeeze your hands tightly, then let them go limp (do the same with your legs and arms, if you can). This helps you release nervous energy without being noticed.</div><h3>Remember Your Greatness</h3><div>The only reason you came in for this interview is because you felt you were good enough to get the job. That is why you've come this far, right? So, remember: They need you, and you have the skills, know-how and drive to prove it. Let the fact that you were chosen to interview among all of the candidates help you refocus and come across as confident and energetic.</div><h3>Admit that You're Nervous</h3><div>There may come a time where your nerves are so apparent that you just can't hide them. If your voice begins to tremble or you start shaking, <a href=""http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/nervous-wreck-5-ways-shake-your-job-interview-anxiety/"">tell the recruiting manager that you're nervous</a>. If you begin to stumble over words or you blank out during a question, politely apologize and let the recruiter know you're having a case of the nerves. Nine times out of 10, the recruiter will tell you that you're doing fine.</div><h3>Pre-Interview Prep</h3><div>To eliminate the risk of having a case of the nerves in an interview, do some role-play before you arrive. Have a friend act as the interviewer and ask you common interview questions. Practice answering these questions with full confidence. The more you practice, the less nervous you will be on the day of your job interview. On that day, wake up early, head out to the interview and take a few deep breaths before heading inside. It works.</div>"Career,5 Successful People Who Started New Careers After 40,"<h1>5 Successful People Who Started New Careers After 40</h1><p>The phrase <i>""</i>It's never too late to teach an old dog new tricks"" isn't just something that pertains to our canine friends. It can be applied to people as well. If there is one thing at which people are capable, it is the ability to adapt. Using that ability, we can take on challenges that at first glance or thought would seem impossible. Flexibility can be put to use in just about any phase of life, but it is especially effective when considering new careers after 40. Here are some great examples of getting started in a new career later in life.</p><h3><b>Ronald Reagan</b> </h3><p>While most of us know Ronald Reagan from his time as president, he was also a fairly successful actor earlier in his life. He even served as president of the Screen Actors Guild. Reagan was 55 years old when he was elected to his first political office, becoming the Governor of California in 1966. Being the spokesman for General Electric, as well as an actor, might not seem like surefire ingredients for a two-term president, but it worked quite well in his case.</p><h3><b>Jack Cover</b></h3><p>Probably the least recognizable name on this list is Jack Cover. While his name might not jump out at you, chances are you know about his invention, the Taser. The early years of Cover's life are impressive; he was a nuclear physicist and worked in the fields of defense and aerospace, even helping his agency become one of the major contributors to NASA's Apollo space program. While Cover was busy in his early avionics career, he followed the news closely. He was compelled by stories of hijackings and invented a non-lethal weapon that is now used in more than 13,000 police and military installations and by nearly 185,000 people globally. Cover was 50 when he began his new career and his new company, Taser, Inc.</p><h3><b>Grandma Moses</b></h3><p>Ana Mary Robertson, more commonly known as Grandma Moses, was definitely a late bloomer. For most of her life, she enjoyed working on her Virginia farm, selling potato chips and embroidering intricate pictures as a hobby. Advancing age and arthritis caused her to retire to her daughter's home in her 80s, and it became difficult for her to hold embroidery needles without pain. Her sister suggested she try painting instead, and Robertson decided to channel her creative talents there. Good thing she picked up the paint brush because she became known as one of the greatest American folk artists, creating several well-known pieces of art and selling out art exhibitions around the country.</p><h3><b>Colonel Sanders</b></h3><p>While most people know the colonel as the head of Kentucky Fried Chicken, he also held many other jobs during his earlier life. After falsifying documents to join the United States Army at the age of 15, he went on to hold various other jobs including insurance salesman, firefighter for the railroad, steamboat pilot and even farmer. At the age of 40, he opened up a service station; he also cooked steaks, country ham and chicken dishes. With his reputation for good food growing, he moved to a 142-seat restaurant adjoining a motel, where he created the now-famous recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken. When the opening of a new interstate cut into his profits, he decided to take his show on the road and he started franchising KFC nationwide.</p><div><div><h3><b>Vera Wang</b></h3><p>Most people know Vera Wang as a famous fashion designer. Few people realize that Vera was once a talented figure skater, a career path that ended with her failure to make the U.S. Olympics team. She began a new career as an editor at Vogue magazine but was passed over for the position of editor-in-chief at the magazine. She then threw herself into her love of fashion. At the age of 40, she started designing wedding dresses and has become one of the most famous fashion designers of our time.</p><p>Use these people as inspiration for considering a new career after 40.

Try to make your exit without burning any bridges. Oh, sure, you might dream of sending a scathing email to your boss or simply walking out of the building with all of the break room granola bars, but these actions are much less satisfying than you imagine. In fact, they can have long-term consequences. If you want to avoid damaging your reputation, and you want to set yourself up for a better job down the road, always leave your job with class. <br></p> <h3><b>Avoid spreading the news too early </b></h3> <p>If your choice to leave your job is a planned move rather than a spur-of-the-moment decision, you will probably spend some time looking for a new job first. If you have become friendly with your coworkers, it is tempting to tell them about your job search, especially once you have found a promising lead. But this type of information has a tendency to spread around the office, in which case your boss could find out about your departure before you have a chance to tell him or her yourself. This is why <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/1824779/how-quit-your-job-gracefully-if-youre-not-greg-smith"">Fast Company</a> advises you to stay quiet until you tell your boss the official news. <br></p> <h3><b>Preserve relationships </b></h3> <p>You never know when a job contact can be useful in the future, so make an effort to stay in touch with managers, coworkers, clients and vendors. Whether you are choosing to leave or are being laid off or fired, thanking the people who helped you during your time at your current job is a good idea. You can send an email or simply shake hands and thank them in person on your way out. <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/06/04/10-tips-for-leaving-your-job-gracefully-"">U.S. News & World Report</a> even suggests that you get some references in writing, either before you leave or shortly afterward. You can also ask to use a manager or a coworker as a reference for your next job. <br></p> <h3><b>Collect helpful information </b></h3> <p>Before you leave, you should get the contact information of colleagues so you can easily stay in touch. Also, keep samples of your work so you can show future employers any writing, designs or other work you have done. Just be sure to check with HR or your boss to make sure this is not against the rules.</p><p>Before you leave, take a tip from <a href=""http://blogs.hbr.org/2010/11/leave-your-job-the-classy-way/"">Harvard Business Review</a> and create a Smile File. This should consist of thank-you notes from your boss, emails complimenting your work, great reviews and any awards you won at that job. Not only will this collection of positive things boost your morale, but it could even help you land your next position.<br></p> <h3><b>Help your employer find a replacement </b></h3> <p>It is still customary to give notice two weeks before you leave a job, though you might want to give more notice if you think it will take longer than two weeks to find your replacement. In fact, some particularly helpful employees go out of their way to ensure a smooth transition for their replacement, boss and the company as a whole. If you still respect your employer and really want to help, this article in<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jaleh-bisharat/how-to-quit-a-job_b_3877020.html"">The Huffington Post</a> advises you to make a cheat sheet for your replacement.</p><p>Make note of everything the new hire needs to know to thrive in the position, and include log-in information, file locations and helpful tips you have learned over the years. You can even volunteer to help advertise the job opening and interview applicants, which should help you get a positive reference from your boss. </p>"Resumes,Never Use the Same Resume Twice,"<h1>Never Use the Same Resume Twice</h1><p>If you upload or mail the same resume every time you apply to a new position, youre missing out on an opportunity to stand out and get noticed. The good news is that you can change your resume strategy right now and improve your chances of landing the next job you want.</p><h3>Why you should customize your resumes</h3><p>Each position you apply for is unique. The resume you use should be also be unique. You could argue that the positions youre applying for are all the same because they have the same job title.

After all, no one wants to admit their shortcomings to someone who has the power to offer them a job. According to <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/why-employers-ask-you-certain-interview-questions-2013-8"">Business Insider</a>, interviewers who ask this question assume applicants will be caught off guard, at which point they will tell them their weakness without thinking it through first. This means that to avoid possibly ruining a chance of getting a job you should make sure you are prepared with a good answer. Here are some effective ways to answer the dreaded question, ""What is Your Greatest Weakness?""<br></p> <h3><b>Reveal a Weakness That Wouldn't Affect Your Position </b></h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2013/01/21/how-to-answer-the-dreaded-what-is-your-biggest-weakness-interview-question/"">Forbes</a>, you should be strategic when you select your answer to this question and take into account what your responsibilities would entail if you got the job. Choose a weakness that would not negatively affect your performance. For example, if you are applying to be a teacher, admitting you have a fear of speaking in front of groups would be inadvisable since that's a large part of the job. Similarly, if you're applying to be a reporter for a newspaper that has deadlines each day, you don't want to admit your inability to adhere to a tight schedule. Instead, you would be better off focusing on your difficulty with math, since this is less likely to affect your job as a writer. <br></p> <h3><b>Be Honest </b></h3> <p><a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/08/23/the-best-answers-for-3-sticky-interview-questions"">U.S. News & World Report</a> advises job seekers to avoid lying when answering this question. Everyone has weaknesses, and you're not going to fool anyone into thinking you're the exception. Even if you take the common tactic of pretending a strength is really a weakness, such as perfectionism, the interviewer will see right through this trick. Instead, be honest about your weakness, but follow up your admission with an explanation of how you are trying to improve. For example, if you are not great at time management, let the interviewer know you have started using to-do lists that have kept you on task. This shows that you are both honest and willing to work to fix your shortcomings.  <br></p> <h3><b>Replace Your Answer with a Wise or Witty Quote </b></h3> <p>If you cannot think of a weakness you want the interviewer to know about, you might be able to get away with offering up a witty quote instead. According to <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2088549/My-greatest-weakness-Job-interviews.html"">The Daily Mail</a>, interviewers sometimes ask this question just to see how well applicants can think on their feet. If you have a quote or short anecdote about what a mentor once taught you about the importance of focusing on strengths, not weaknesses, you can mention that. This tactic has worked for a number of applicants, but it requires some confidence so you can rattle it off with conviction rather than looking like you are trying to get out of revealing your greatest weakness. <br></p>"Career,What a Career Coach Does,"<h1>Is a Career Coach Right for You?<br></h1> <p>If you spend time on the Internet searching for jobs, chances are youve seen advertisements for career coaches. Perhaps youve even wondered if a professional career coach can help you find a better job. Let's explore.</p> <h3>What does a career coach do? </h3> <p>A career coach will work with you to help you identify your professional strengths and weaknesses. This may involve assessing your talents at negotiating, communicating and presenting your work, as well as your skills at applying yourself. A coach will also help you examine where you are in your career, why youre there and whether or not its where you truly want to be.In addition, if youre between jobs, a coach can help you utilize your skills and tools to their fullest potential when it comes to marketing, networking and maneuvering yourself into that ideal job.</p> <p>As for pros and cons, a career coach will:</p> <p></p><ul><li>Help you prioritize your professional needs<br></li><li>Help you identify and market your skills<br></li><li>Help you pinpoint what youre doing right and what youre doing wrong in your career<br></li></ul><p></p> <p>A career coach wont:</p> <p></p><ul><li>Get you a job<br></li><li>Be free</li></ul><p></p> <h3>Can a coach get you a job?</h3> <p>The short answer to that question is ""no."" A good coach, however, can give you the tools and the self-confidence to help you identify the right job, as well as help you find the shortest, most effective path to getting hired. </p> <h3>Will an executive coach get you an executive job?</h3> <p>Executive coaches specialize in helping corporate employees work their way up the proverbial company ladder. There are, however, some exceptions. For example, a good executive coach may help you realize that youre not only on the wrong rung, but youre also on the wrong ladder altogether. By analyzing the good and the bad elements of your professional life, you and your coach can determine whether or not youre in the right company or even in the right industry. </p> <h3>Does a career coach help everyone?</h3> <p>A coach can advise you, but ultimately youll still have to temper your ambitions with a heavy dose of reality. For example, if youve always wanted to quit work and open up a hot air balloon business, then a career counselor can help you figure out how you can do this and may even give you the encouragement you need. If you dont have the financial capital, youll still need to hang on to your current job for a bit longer. Your coach isnt going to make miracles happen. </p> <p>Many coaches come with accreditation from groups, such as the <a href=""http://www.coachfederation.org/"">International Coach Federation</a>, so talk to your coach about his or her credentials. As with any type of mentoring experience, people occasionally <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2012/03/07/when-career-coaching-is-a-waste-of-your-money/"">report bad experiences</a> with their career counselors, but this could be because of factors such as inexperience on the coachs part or simply a lack of chemistry and understanding between coach and client.</p> <p>If youre interested in hiring a career coach, the best thing you can do is get recommendations. Talk to friends and colleagues, research websites and get as many professional references as you can. By doing a bit of homework and keeping an open mind, you can find a coach who can help you get your career moving in the right direction.</p>"Job Search Tips,Where to Find Job Salaries,"<h1>Where to Find Job Salaries</h1><p>Job salaries used to be closely guarded secrets, and until recently, it was nearly impossible to make systematic comparisons between two different career paths or between salary levels for the same job in two geographic regions. Now, however, salary information is abundant, and you can do a variety of statistical searches. Here are some of the best places to find good in-depth information:</p><h3>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</h3><p>The <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/bls/blswage.htm"">BLS</a> is part of the U.S. Department of Labor and is responsible for gathering and sharing all kinds of statistics related to the countrys workforce. The most useful entry point into this massive storehouse of information is the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/"">Occupational Outlook Handbook</a>. From this main page, you can choose among occupation groups and click on the one that covers the job in which youre interested. You will land on a page with a summary of basic information for all the jobs in that group. Clicking on an individual job title brings you to a page focused on that single job, offering a range of detailed information. This information includes current salary figures and projected growth in the field in the next 10 years, as well as a lot of other relevant information. </p>The advantage of this federal website is that it gathers huge quantities of information, since it has access to statistics kept by the IRS and Department of Labor. The downside of the BLS website is its massive bureaucratic tradition; although its mandate is to provide information to the public, the sites sheer size and complexity make it cumbersome.<h3>Simply Hired</h3><div>Simply Hireds ""<a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/salaries.html"">Simply Salary</a>"" page gathers data from all of the millions of job listings that its search engine compiles. This salary calculator allows you to enter skills as well as job titles, which allows for a broad, organic form of research. The results page explains how the average salary was arrived at, and then lists a collection of jobs with titles related to your search terms . On the right side of the page is a ""trends"" link, where you can access a visual graph of salary levels over the past year. Simply Hired also narrows searches down by location and allows users to shift their search from ""salaries"" to ""jobs."" <br><h3>Glassdoor</h3><p><a href=""http://www.glassdoor.com"">Glassdoor</a> is a career community. It provides inside information generated by people who actually work at the company you search for, so you can see reports from current employees on all sorts of workplace issues. You can search for salaries for a given job title, profession or company and narrow your search down by region. Based on ratings from current workers, Glassdoor has features such as ""Top 25 Companies to Work for"" and ""Top Companies for Work-Life Balance."" Applying the power of user reviews to rank employers helps tilt the power balance in the direction of the worker.</p><h3>Salary.com</h3><p>This site offers a ""<a href=""http://salary.com/category/salary/"">U.S. Salary Wizard</a>,"" which allows you to search for job salaries either by category or income level, integrated with a particular region. It does not allow searches by company, as Glassdoor does, but it does offer the functionality of a special paid personal salary report. This report is customized according to multiple variables and is intended to help you with negotiating a current or future salary.</p><h3>PayScale</h3><p><a href=""http://payscale.com"">PayScale</a> offers the same ability to search for a particular job function and location, and it puts special focus on trending statistics, offering reports on trends indexed by city, industry, company or job category. PayScale also offers a number of additional features, including a ""Cost of Living"" calculator and a ranking of colleges according to the pay levels of their graduates.</p><p>These resources allow you to conduct your job search confidently, armed with all the information you could possibly need on job salaries in your field.</p></div>"Resumes,What to Leave Out of a Cover Letter,"<h1><b>What to Leave Out of a Cover Letter</b></h1><p></p><p>A good cover letter spotlights a candidates strengths and how he or she would fit into an organization. Unfortunately, too many applicants fail to write a good cover letter, which generally can be attributed to these three reasons:</p><p></p><ul><li>They dont include enough information.<br></li><li>They include too much information.<br></li><li>They dont include the right kind of information.<br></li></ul><p></p><p>Making these mistakes can lead to few or no job interviews, which will harm your career prospects. To improve your chances of getting a phone call from an employer, learn what to leave out of a cover letter. </p><h3><b>Generic Language</b></h3><p>A cover letter is not simply a one-paragraph statement of your interest in a position. It is a place for you to sell your qualifications to an employer. To do this, you need to write a unique cover letter for each job for which you are applying. <a href=""http://ucs.yalecollege.yale.edu/content/cover-letters"">Yale College</a> recommends that you explain how your experience meets the qualifications of the job and how your skills could benefit the organization. This is also a good opportunity for you to show your knowledge of the company, a move that always impresses a hiring manager.</p><h3><b>Excessive Wordiness</b></h3><p>Corporate recruiting strategist<a href=""http://www.ere.net/2013/05/20/why-you-cant-get-a-job-recruiting-explained-by-the-numbers/"">John Sullivan</a>says that a company receives an average of 250 resumes for every job opening. Hiring managers do not have time to read all the cover letters that are included, and they appreciate ones that that are short and to the point. If you send a cover letter that exceeds one page, it is more likely to end up in the trash bin rather than in the potential interview pile.</p><h3><b>Summarizing the Resume</b></h3><p>In<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/sethporges/2012/08/29/6-secrets-to-writing-a-great-cover-letter/"">Forbes</a>, veteran writer Seth Porges says that many people mistakenly assume that a cover letter is just a repeat of the resume in letter form. Because the employer already has a copy of your resume, summarizing it will not improve your chances of getting an interview. Porges recommends that you use the cover letter to show your personality and knowledge of the field and the company for which you are applying. You can choose to reference an experience or event listed on your resume, but do so only to explain how that that event provided you with the skills or experience that would make you a better candidate for the position.</p><h3><b>Talking About College</b></h3><p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/08/cover_letter_writing_advice_how_to_write_a_cover_letter_for_an_entry_level.html"">Katherine Goldstein</a>, innovations editor for <i>Slate</i>, has reviewed hundreds of resumes and cover letters during her tenure with the online magazine. One of her biggest pet peeves is when the cover letter talks about college, especially after the applicant has graduated. Like most employers, she is only interested in experience that will help her company. Goldsteins advice is that if youre not currently a student, do not mention your GPA, your Ivy League education, your college coursework or your senior thesis in your cover letter. And definitely do not attach a chapter of the thesis to your application.</p><h3><b>Not Following Instructions</b></h3><p>When Goldstein posts job openings, she frequently includes specific instructions for applying to the position. She does this, in part, to gauge respondents ability to follow instructions and see how detail-oriented they are. If they fail to follow instructions to the letter, they may be disqualified. To avoid having your cover letter and resume thrown in the reject pile, Goldstein recommends that you read the submission instructions very carefully and follow them.</p>"Interviews,What You Don't Have to Say During a Job Interview,"<h1><b>What You Dont Have to Say During a Job Interview</b></h1><p>As you prepare to answer tough job interview questions, you should know that you don't have to answer them all. That's because some are illegal for the interviewer to ask. If an interviewer asks you, more often than not by accident, about any of the following details, consider your answer carefully. Formulate a response that relates to your qualifications for job, and leave out personal details that could lead to discrimination during the hiring process.</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Age</b>: According to this handy piece in<a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/careers/resources/interviewillegal.htm"">USA Today</a>, the interviewer only needs to know if you are over the age of 18. You can answer this question, but you do not have to reveal your exact age or birth date. You do not even have to say when you graduated from college, since this is a sneaky way to estimate your age.</li><li><b>Health and disabilities</b>: All that should matter is that you are able to complete the duties of the job. While interviewers can ask if you can lift a certain amount of weight and reach a specific height, they are not allowed to ask how much you weigh, how tall you are or if you have had any recent illnesses or surgeries. The only time they can inquire about these details is after you are offered the job, at which point they will have to make reasonable accommodations for you.<br></li><li><b>Language and nationality</b>: It might seem like a harmless question when interviewers ask you if they detect a foreign accent, but this is getting into dangerous territory. Thats because, according to <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/11-illegal-interview-questions-2013-7?op=1"">Business Insider</a>, they are not allowed to ask about your country of origin or native language. You only have to say you are eligible to work in the U.S., and then you can ignore more specific questions of this nature.<br></li><li><b>Debt</b>: Business Insider reports that employers need to have your express permission to find out about your credit history. At that point, they will probably just run a credit check rather than ask about it during the interview, so do not feel pressured to answer direct questions about your credit record or amount of debt.<br></li><li><b>Arrest record</b>: Interviewers can legally ask if you have been convicted of a crime that relates to the position for which you are interviewing. But that doesnt mean they can ask for all the details about your arrest record. So if the job would entail driving, they can ask if you have a DUI on your record, but this question would not be appropriate during an interview for a copy-writing position.<br></li><li><b>Religion</b>: It is illegal to ask about religion, and you can refuse to answer any questions about it. The only thing interviewers need to know is if you have any limitations that would affect your job, such as your willingness to work on Sundays. If this question is asked, feel free to answer honestly, leaving out any mention of your religion.<br></li><li><b>Marital status</b>: Interviewers are not supposed to come right out and ask if you are married or have kids, but they can ask questions about whether you would be willing to travel or work overtime. Be honest when you answer this question, but keep in mind that the job interview is not the time to mention that you would need to make childcare arrangements in advance. There will be plenty of time to determine these details once you get the job.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p>"Career,Successful People Who Had Unusual Careers,"<div><div><h1>Successful People Who Had Unusual Careers</h1><p></p></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><p>Some of the most well-known business successes started off with humble jobs and wound up with unusual, yet outstanding careers.

But he had plans. At night, he took business classes at a local college. After a couple of years as a sales assistant, he tried his hand at clothing design, eventually creating a necktie that would catch the eye of famous designers. Soon after, he quit his job to create his own company. Neiman Marcus gave him his first big break by buying dozens of the ties he designed. His commitment to learning the business side of fashion on his own time allowed him to branch out from his job at a major clothing store and become a success in the fashion industry. <br></p> <h3>Roman Abramovich: From Toy Sales to Business Buyouts </h3> <p>Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich now owns Britain's Chelsea Football Club and is among the richest people in the world, according to <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-299664/Britains-new-richest-man.html"">The Daily Mail</a>.

He went to school and made dolls, gradually investing in other businesses along the way. As he accumulated wealth, he continued to buy up businesses in various industries, leading him to become a self-made billionaire. </p> <h3>Howard Schultz: From Xerox Copies to Starbucks Coffee </h3> <p>Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, got his start in a career that had nothing to do with coffee.

He decided to visit Starbucks in Seattle and was invited to become the head of marketing and retail operations. Seeing potential in the small company, he eventually bought the chain and made several improvements, helping Starbucks expand greatly during the 1990s.

Your body language is under observation before the first question is asked, and maybe even before you and your interviewer are introduced to one another. How you present yourself, the way you walk and even the way you talk will all factor into the interviewer's opinion of how you would fit in with the company. Here are five body language tips to keep in mind for your next job interview.<br></p><h3><b>1. Posture</b></h3><p>Good posture makes you look confident. Use good posture at all times when you arrive at your job interview. This goes for walking in, sitting in the waiting room, walking to your interview and sitting down during your interview. You never know who is watching you. Walk upright and not hunched over, with your chin up and arms at your side<b>. </b>Sit upright with your chin up and keep both feet on the floor. Your hands should be either resting on your knees or clasped in front of you; crossing your legs is frowned upon because some feel it makes you look too relaxed. For women, crossing your legs at the ankles is a good compromise. </p><h3><b>2. Smile</b></h3><p>This should be something that you plan to do first and foremost when you enter a room, both at the front desk as you check in and with the interviewer. This will let an employer know you are happy to be there and display that you have a positive attitude as well. The bigger the smile, the better, as long as it doesn't come off as forced or fake. A bright smile will reflect your enthusiasm, so use it to your advantage.</p><h3><b>3. Handshake</b></h3><p>Use a good, firm handshake when you are interviewing. A firm handshake is a business prerequisite that reflects enthusiasm and professionalism; do not underestimate its importance. A limp or weak handshake displays a lack of energy, confidence and enthusiasm and gives the idea that you may approach your work in the same fashion. You should also check to be sure your hands aren't damp. If you sometimes have this problem, give your hands a quick check before entering the interview room. </p><h3><b>4. Eye Contact</b></h3><p>Eye contact is a vital sign of body language that interviewers will watch closely. Making eye contact with your interviewer shows that you are listening and interested in what is being said. You should also nod every now and then to let the interviewer know that you understand the conversation and agree. Breaking eye contact briefly every so often is wise as well, because prolonged eye contact can be awkward. By maintaining proper eye contact you also show the interviewer that you aren't intimidated by the interview process.</p><h3><b>5. Hand Gestures</b></h3>Some people say not to talk with your hands at a job interview, but actually you should use hand gestures when it makes sense. However, keep hand gestures to a minimum. While small gestures look genuine, large and sweeping motions can make you appear to be a loose cannon. Not using gestures at all can make you come across as stiff or fake. Natural hand gestures are good; just don't overdo it!<p></p><p></p><p>Relax, but remain aware of your body language. Be polite, professional and friendly<b></b>and sit up straight! You will make a better impression on your interviewer.</p><p></p><p></p>"Career,5 Careers in Sports and How to Score One,"<h1><b>5 Careers in Sports and How to Score One</b><b></b></h1> <p>Although most people who love sports will never land a job on a professional team as a player, coach or manager, there are plenty of great careers in sports for non-athletes. With experience and perseverance, you can pursue and land a job in sports. Here are five careers in the sports industry that are in demand.</p> <h3><b>Physical Therapist</b></h3> <p>For those who want to be involved with sports medicine, physical therapy is a good avenue. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that the job outlook for this profession is excellent. Many athletes sustain injuries, and its the job of the physical therapist to help the athlete manage pain and improve movement of the injured area. A masters degree and licensing is usually required.</p> <h3><b>Sports Psychologist</b></h3> <p>Many sports psychologists work directly with athletes to improve their mental health and emotional well-being. Psychologists help athletes with a wide range of issues, such as performance problems, stress reduction, injuries and coping skills. According to the BLS, the job outlook for psychologists will grow nearly 22 percent by 2020. Most psychologists need a master's degree; many also possess a doctorate.</p> <h3><b>Sports Agent</b></h3> <p>A sports agent represents professional athletes, marketing them to prospective teams, negotiating salaries and contracts and obtaining endorsement deals. Most agents handle all legal and financial issues related to managing the athlete. While some agents have no formal education in the field, aspiring agents often have a degree in sports management or sports business. There is a wider range of paths to becoming a sports agent than there are for other sports-related careers.</p> <h3><b>Public Relations Specialist</b></h3> <p>The public image of individual athletes and professional teams is important throughout the world of sports. Public relations (PR) specialists create media materials such as press releases to keep their clients in the spotlight while working with the media to maintain a positive public image for a team and its players. Many people who work in sports as a PR specialist have a degree in communications, journalism or business. The job outlook in the public relations field is strong.<b></b></p> <h3><b>Sports Merchandising</b></h3> <p>Selling sports merchandise is big business for both professional and collegiate athletic teams. The merchandise includes shirts, caps, sweatshirts, mugs and other paraphernalia that include the team's logo, mascot or name. Sales reps sell this merchandise at sporting events, in retail stores and online. A degree is often unnecessary to sell sports merchandise.</p> <h3><b>Getting a Job in Sports</b></h3> <p>It always helps to know someone. Work your network.

They need an outstanding resume as well. When creating your first resume as an undergrad, including the right information is important. One question that seems to be on every college grad's mind is whether or not grade point average (GPA) has a place on a resume. The short answer: it depends.</p><p></p><h3><b>Whats your GPA?</b></h3>Know where you stand. Is your GPA high, low or average? The <a href=""http://smg.bu.edu/upo/docs/Guidelines-IncludingGPAonResumes.pdf"">Feld Career Center at Boston University </a>suggests including your cumulative GPA only if it is above 3.0. It recommends that you carry it two places past the decimal (i.e. 3.77, not 3.8) to ensure that you are representing yourself truthfully. If your cumulative grade-point average is lower than youd like, you could opt for using your major's GPA or concentration's GPA instead, as long as you indicate clearly which one it is.<p></p><p></p><h3><b>What are your strengths?</b></h3>Remember, the purpose of your resume is to showcase your strengths, not to point out your shortcomings. If you were far from the head of the class, consider omitting your GPA altogether. Do make sure you emphasize strong areas, though. Maybe youre an excellent team player, an excellent leader or an award-winning orator. Be sure to let prospective employers know how much you have to offer beyond your test scores, and be prepared to back up any claims you make once you land an interview.<p></p><p></p><h3><b>Whats your industry?</b></h3>Different fields have different attitudes toward grade point averages. Technical fields, such as engineering and computer science, expect to see GPA in candidate's resumes, while liberal arts and graphic design employers are not as likely to expect to see them. One major at <a href=""http://www.career.vt.edu/resumeguide/FAQs.html"">Virginia Tech</a> actually considers 3.4 to be the minimum grade point average for students. If you know the interviewer is absolutely going to be looking for a GPA on your resume because it is standard in your field, but youre not very proud of your 2.91, its better to include it than to let the interviewer guess. Would you rather him see your 2.91 or assume you had a 2.75?<p></p><p></p><h3><b>How much experience do you have?</b></h3>When you have several years of relevant experience, your GPA becomes unimportant. By being able to prove that you have strong, well-developed skills and an established track record, employers find it less important for you to show your collegiate grades. Employers will be much more satisfied to see what you have done with your education, rather than how well you did on your tests.<p></p><p></p><h3><b>The bottom line</b></h3>When you are completing your resume, its important to make yourself look great. In a sea of competition, you need to be able to prove youre the best catch. When it comes to your GPA, you should absolutely include yours if its high for your industry or if you believe it is a good representation of your abilities. Dont feel obligated to include your GPA if its not very high. Just be willing to go the extra mile to prove your worthiness to potential employers. At the end of the day, if an interviewer wants to know, they will ask."Interviews,How to Use Humor During a Job Interview,"<h1>5 Ways to Use Humor in a Job Interview</h1> <p>You got your foot in the door, and its time for your job interview. You shook hands, sat down, and youre smiling at the person across the desk. Suddenly, you find yourself saying, ""So, stop me if youve heard this one. A guy walks into a bar""</p><p>If youve ever started an interview this way, its a safe bet you didnt get the job. To say that jokes are considered time-wasters in a job interview is an understatement. However, there are ways you can use humor in a job interview to your advantage.Here are five ways you can use humor to lighten up the atmosphere without jeopardizing your prospects.</p> <p></p><h3><b>Scope out your interviewer</b></h3>If you see the barest hint of an obligatory job interview smile, use humor sparingly. For example, you can have a chuckle, ever so slightly, about the easier commute to this new location. If, on the other hand, youre lucky enough to get a genial, smiling interviewer, you can relax a bit<b></b>just not too much.<p></p> <h3><b>Use humor as an inflection, not as a key to your personality</b></h3><p>You dont want to come across as a laugh-a-minute type of person; it's obnoxious in a work setting. Just as some people talk too much when theyre nervous, some people try to be funny in order to mask their nerves. If youve noticed that the jokes are starting to fly, take it down several notches.</p> <h3><b>Keep it general</b></h3><p>Everyone has a different sense of humor, and people react to funny comments in different ways. For these reasons, its best to keep your observations as general as possible, talking about things that we can all relate to, such as the weather or the traffic. They might not seem like prime laugh material, but unless youre auditioning for a position as a piano bar entertainer, they're a lot safer.</p> <h3><b>Aim for being pleasant rather than funny</b></h3><p>Youre not selling yourself as a comedian. Youre selling yourself as an engaged, easy-to-work-with co-worker. Youll want your interviewers notes to read, ""ready with a smile"" rather than ""cracks jokes all the time."" </p> <h3><b>Instead of jokes, use little asides</b></h3><p>Chances are theres not going to be time for a joke-telling session during your interview, so instead, focus on interjecting a few humorous remarks at the right time. These can be self-deprecating. For example, if you have several glowing newspaper write-ups in your portfolio, you can say, ""Oh, well, it was a slow news week."" If youve won Employee of the Month a number of times, you can say, ""Stuffing the ballot box works every time."" But before you indulge in self-deprecating humor, check to see it your interviewer has a sense of humor to begin with, and dont say anything that he or she might take seriously.</p> <p>If you decide to use humor in a job interview, you will be walking a tightrope. However, if you can pull it off, the effort is worth it. After all, job sites like <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> are full of job postings that mention ""A sense of humor is a must in this job."" As long as you keep it clean, keep it appropriate and dont bring out your killer Beavis and Butthead imitations, a touch of humor can distance you from the rest of the pack.<br><br></p> <p><b>For More Info:</b></p> <p><a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-57391371/no-joke-how-to-use-humor-in-a-job-interview/"">No Joke: How to Use Humor in a Job Interview</a> (CBS News)</p><p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nancy-berk/humor-on-the-job-intervie_b_3837214.html"">Humor in the Job Interview is No Laughing Matter</a> (Huffington Post)</p>"Career,How to Start a Career in Fashion,"<h1>Nine Ways to Start a Career in Fashion<br></h1> <p>You love fashion, and you think you possess the talent and commitment it takes to be a designer but how do you start a career in fashion? Here are nine tips.</p><h3>Scope Out the Competition</h3><p>You wont go far unless you do plenty of research on why certain designs make fashionistas tick. This means paying close attention to what sells as well as what doesnt. Analyze the components of leading fashion trends and check out the bestsellers of the worlds leading fashion houses. Incorporate what you learn. For example, if you discover that large handbags are a perennial favorite, then capitalize on this knowledge by creating a line of roomy, commodious totes, hobos and satchels.</p> <h3>Meet Everyone</h3><p>Networking will give you your most important entries into the fashion world, so its crucial to be seen. Show up at everything, and meet the movers and shakers in your industry. Let them know what youre doing, how your work is different and why youre passionate about it.</p> <h3>Pay Attention to Marketing Prospects</h3><p>Its a good idea to attend retail industry shows, especially ones that involve new product marketing. Go anywhere you can display models of your creations. Retail executives often send buyers to these types of shows, and if you can impress the right person, you might end up with a retail contract.</p> <h3>Consider the Importance of Design School</h3><p>Not every big-name fashion designer has a diploma from a fashion institute, but a reputable school can give you a solid background that will better prepare you for the demands of the industry and can give you a wealth of networking opportunities.</p> <h3>Consider Being an Apprentice</h3><p>If youve got the time and enough money in your savings account, consider getting in touch with one of the famous design houses in New York or Europe and apprenticing yourself there. You wont make much money, youll work long hours and you may have to put up with temper tantrums, but youll learn virtually everything you need to know about the fashion industry.<br></p> <h3>Break in Through Retail</h3><p>If youre an absolute beginner, consider working in an upscale boutique where you can learn about marketing and identifying your target audience. By checking job sites such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>, you can find retailers that could give you the experience you need to further your fashion career.</p> <h3>Dont be a Jack-of-All-Trades</h3><p>Find your niche and stick to it. If you have a talent or special interest in evening wear, for example, then concentrate on this genre. Likewise, if your great love is accessories, concentrate on these rather than trying to develop a full clothing line.<br></p> <h3>Get Organized</h3><p>Make a list of goals, such as retailers for which youd like to design or designers for whom youd like to work. Strategize so that you can reach these specific goals but dont try to rush things too much. A great fashion career doesnt happen overnight, and it takes years to develop your network, not to mention your skills.<br></p> <h3>Be Prepared for Success</h3><p>Dont set up meetings with influential designers or retailers without having a rock-solid fashion portfolio. If possible, try to arrange it so that youve had at least one small-scale fashion show or some impressive-looking fashion sales (of your own designs) under your belt before trying to hit the big time. If youve got a loaded resume, the giants in the industry will take you much more seriously.</p> <p>In the end, the most important thing you can do is keep your head on your shoulders and be realistic. Stay passionate, but dont romanticize about the so-called glamour aspects of a career in fashion. Its not only hard work; it also demands a certain amount of natural skill and ability. Its one of those super-difficult, yet ultra-rewarding jobs that many would do, if they could.</p> <p></p>"Job Search Tips,Is it OK to Contact a Company After Applying for a Job?,"<h1>Is it OK to Contact a Company After Applying for a Job?</h1><p>After applying for a job you really want, you might wonder what you can do to increase your chances of being noticed by the hiring manager. The good news is you can do more than just wait around and hope after sending your resume. In many cases, contacting the company is considered a good move, as long as you follow a few basic rules and don't show you're overeager. <br></p> <h3>Be Patient <br></h3> <p>It is not unusual for companies to attract thousands of applicants for a single position. It will take more than a day or two for the HR team or its software to sort through the applications, so resist the urge to call the same day you submit your resume. <a href=""http://work.chron.com/call-inquire-job-after-submitting-resume-8225.html"">The Houston Chronicle</a> advises that you wait about one week before you contact anyone at the company. <br></p> <h3>Read the Fine Print Before Reaching Out <br></h3> <p>Some employers have preferences when it comes to contact with applicants. Be sure to read any information you have about the application process to see if there are instructions for job candidates. For example, some companies request that you not call them, and nearly all of them advise against applicants showing up at their office out of the blue. To be on the safe side, <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/01/23/how-to-follow-up-on-your-job-application"">U.S. News & World Report</a> suggests sending an email, since this method of contact is not obtrusive and does not require an immediate response. This way, even if you don't get a response back regarding your application, you have done your part to show you are interested in the company. <br></p> <h3>Find the Right Contact Information <br></h3> <p>When it comes to contacting an employer, the more specific you are, the better. Ideally, you should be able to address the person in charge of making hiring decisions. If you do not know the name of this person, you might have to do some research online to find it. According to the Houston Chronicle, you can also call the company and ask for the name of the person in charge of hiring for the position in which you are interested. Then you can include the name and title in the email or at least address the right person over the phone if you prefer to call to check on your application. <br></p> <h3>Be Polite <br></h3> <p>If you have been waiting for weeks with no reply, you might be feeling anxious and impatient, but don't let the employer know that. Make sure you are calm and collected when you call or email about the job. You may contact the company a few different times to get answers after applying for a job, but avoid calling every day. Your goal is to show you are interested in the position, not obsessive about it. <br></p><p></p><p> </p><h3>What to Include in Your Follow-Up Email <br></h3> <p>If you decide to send an email about the job, focus on being both succinct and professional. Leave out any emoticons or slang, and keep it just a few sentences long. According to <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2010/12/27/how-to-follow-up-after-applying-for-a-job"">U.S. News & World Report</a>, mention that you submitted an application for a job ad and would like to make sure it was received. Be sure to state which position you're contacting the company about and the date you sent the application, and then wrap up the email by reiterating your interest and suitability for the job. You can save the longer follow-up email for after you get an interview!</p>"Resumes,Is it Necessary to Include Every Job You've Had on a Resume?,"<h1>Is it Necessary to Include Every Job You've Had on a Resume?</h1><p>You've graduated into a weak economy, and you don't have a lot of job experience. Or maybe you're just starting your career. You want to make the most of what you have done to catch the eyes of hiring managers. You put hours of time into your resume, making a list of every job you've held since you could work. Food service, lawn care, babysittingif you remember it, you put it on the resume.</p><p>You are quite proud of your five-page resume, but for some reason you don't get nearly the response you expected. Why? Because you're including too much information.</p><p>You don't need to include every job you've ever had on your resume.</p><div><h3>Picking and Choosing</h3></div><p>The first thing to ask yourself: Is this job relevant to the job I am seeking? Instead of including many unrelated jobs on your resume, choose the positions that required skills and expertise desirable to your future employer. When you limit the number of jobs listed on your resume, you might wonder if your resume is too short. But the hiring manager will be pleased that you spent time tailoring your resume to the position. He doesn't have to wonder why you included the job you held at age 16 because you only revealed relevant experience.</p><p>You might worry that you've recently graduated and you've never worked in your chosen field. The best option for overcoming this resume shortcoming is an internship.</p><p>Internships are not always an option, however, so comb over your previous positions. You probably have some applicable skills that match up with the position you're seeking. List those jobs if they exemplify the skills necessary for the job you seek.</p><p>Think of your resume as a marketing tool. You want to convince your employer to pick you, and that's not going to happen if the signal-to-noise ratio in your resume is skewed.</p><p>Once you get a good template set, you can use it to alter your resume to include different job types and industries so each resume you send is unique. While human resources workers can't tell you specifically how they rate prospective employees, they will tell you that putting every job you have ever had on your resume is not the way to go.</p><div><h3><b>What about Contract and Other Short-Term Positions?</b></h3></div><p>If you had a job that lasted a few months, and it was not a short-term contract position, consider not including it on your resume. Why? You don't want your job history showing that you frequently moved from job to job. It's expensive to train an employee. Each employee is an investment, and no one wants to invest in an individual who is going to jump ship as soon as he gets the chance.</p><p>Contract positions are a entirely different subject, as they're intended to be short-term projects. As with your job history, keep only the relevant contract positions on your resume. If you have related skills for the contract gigs, include these as well. Some contract work is tricky to list, especially if you signed a non-disclosure agreement with your client. If this is the case, don't mention the position or the clients protected under the agreement. Otherwise, relevant contracts are great to list on your resume, as they show that you're flexible with your work.</p>"Interviews,Avoid Saying These Words During Job Interviews,"<h1>Avoid Saying These Words During Job Interviews</h1><p>If you're not acing your job interviews, the words you use could be part of the problem. Fortunately for you, something like your vocabulary is fairly easy to fix. Here are eight words you should avoid during interviews and why. <br></p> <p><b>1. Try </b></p> <p><a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/passive-aggressive-diaries/201005/passive-aggressive-words-in-the-workplace"">Psychology Today</a> calls this word a passive aggressive term that you should not use in any field. It can suggest that you do not plan to give a particular task all of your effort, which won't impress many interviewers. Using this word can also indicate that you lack passion, since it is noncommittal. <br></p> <p><b>2. Maybe </b></p> <p>This is another noncommittal word. It doesn't display any confidence in your ability to make a decision or complete a task. <br></p> <p><b>3. Grueling </b></p> <p>Even if you are describing a difficult project at your last job, or are somehow putting this word into a positive context, it probably won't help you win favor with interviewers. That's because, according to <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/6285-words-hurt.html"">Live Science</a>, studies show that the brain has a negative reaction to words that describe pain. In fact, such terms can bring on memories of painful experiences in others. This is not how you want your interviewer to remember you. So be sure to stay away from ""grueling,"" ""tormenting,"" ""torture"" and similar words that run the risk of triggering bad associations.</p> <p><b>4. Fired </b></p> <p>Studies show that the brain remembers bad things more clearly than good things. When you bring up words with negative connotations, including ""fired"" or ""terminated,"" it could leave a bad impression with interviewers since they will remember the negative things you said more than the positive. <br></p> <p><b>5. Workaholic </b></p> <p>You might assume that being a workaholic is appealing to employers, but <a href=""http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2013/05/10/classic-interview-mistakes/"">Fortune</a> reports that it could indicate that you do not know how to prioritize. If you have to work overtime on a consistent basis just to get the job done, you might not be very effective at work during regular hours. Plus, not all employers want someone chained to the desk; many want you to be well-rounded as a person. <br></p> <p><b>6. We </b></p> <p>Try to avoid using this word much, if at all. You might want to show that you can work well in a team, but according to <a href=""http://blog.chron.com/careerrescue/2012/11/dont-say-that-phrases-to-avoid-during-an-interview/"">The Houston Chronicle</a>, emphasizing this word might give the impression that you cannot work on projects alone. Remember that you are the one in the interview, not your coworkers, so focus on what you in particular can bring to the table. <br></p> <p><b>7. Innovative </b></p> <p>It can be tempting to use this adjective to describe yourself, especially when you're interviewing for a company that encourages creativity and outside-the-box thinking. This is just one of many overused buzzwords that employers are tired of hearing. Similar words to avoid include ""motivated,"" ""entrepreneurial"" and ""dynamic."" <br></p> <p><b>8. Impossible </b></p> <p>This word can indicate that you are not willing to rise to the challenge to get something done. In fact, <a href=""http://blog.grantham.edu/blog/bid/143814/5-Words-to-Erase-from-Your-Vocabulary-in-Job-Interviews"">Grantham University</a> reports that it can make you come off as lazy or unwilling to work to meet a goal. As you'll find in all job interviews you go to, employers are not interested in hiring job applicants who give up before they even get started on a task. </p><p>Steer clear of the above words on your job interviews and you will leave a much better impression and increase your chances of getting hired.</p>"Career,The 5 Fastest-Shrinking Jobs,"<h1>The 5 Fastest-Shrinking Jobs</h1><p>If you are looking for a new career, it's not a bad idea to avoid industries that appear to be on the decline. This is especially true for positions that require time and money for specific training, only for the ranks of employment within that field to be reduced soon after. Below are five of the fastest-shrinking jobs in America. It's possible to get work in these fields, but you'll find that other careers are far more promising.<br></p> <h3>Postal Workers </h3> <p>Youve probably noticed the increased dependency on technology when it comes to staying in contact with loved ones, paying bills and shopping from catalogs. If you tend to use a computer for these tasks, you can see why postal workers are not nearly as necessary as they once were. Not surprisingly, the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_105.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> claims that postal jobs are on the decline. More specifically, postal service worker positions will be cut by about 48 percent by the year 2020 while postmaster jobs will decline by nearly 28 percent. <br></p> <h3>Farmers and Ranchers <br></h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.boston.com/bostonworks/galleries/30fast_declining_occupations?pg=25"">The Boston Globe</a>, agricultural jobs will be cut by about 8 percent by 2020. The reason for this is that farms have been consolidating while at the same time, the productivity of farming operations has been increasing. That means fewer farmers and ranchers are needed. But the good news is there will still be some need for a new generation of farmers as the current ones retire. If you're passionate about agriculture, you might have a better chance in this industry if you are willing to keep up with the latest farming technologies and get a 2- or 4-year degree in this field. <br></p> <h3>Desktop Publishers </h3> <p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/02/jobs-disappearing-dying-declining-layoffs_n_1847119.html#slide=1459767"">The Huffington Post</a> reports a decline in the desktop publishing industry, which involves formatting and then printing books, brochures, newsletters, calendars and other materials that are now increasingly digital. More specifically, this field is set to decline by nearly 15 percent in the coming years. Some materials are no longer printed these days, but digital publications still need to be formatted. This means you can survive in this field if you can embrace the technology used today in desktop publishing. If you are familiar with the latest desktop publishing software, HTML, and web developing basics, you can still work on formatting websites, e-books, online magazines, email newsletters, and other digital publications. For the best chance at this type of job, make sure you have an associate's degree. <br></p> <h3>Data Entry Workers </h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.boston.com/bostonworks/galleries/30fast_declining_occupations?pg=30"">The Boston Globe</a>, data entry positions will decline by about 7 percent by 2020. This is another casualty of the growing technology industry because software programs can now do the job of the typical data entry worker. Similarly, typists are not relied on as much because most people have their own computers. If you want to work in these types of positions, you are advised to have a few different skills that make you more valuable to employers. This means you should combine data entry, proofreading and telephone skills so you can apply for positions that include secretary or personal assistant. <br></p> <h3>Textile Machine Setters </h3> <p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/the-30-jobs-that-are-disappearing-fastest-in-america-2012-2?op=1"">Business Insider</a> reports that several jobs related to textiles will be on the decline. More specifically, shrinking jobs include textile machine setters, tenders and operators, all of which are expected to decline by about 18 percent by 2020. The reason is that companies in the U.S. can do these jobs less expensively overseas. This means many companies will increasingly choose to import textiles from other countries.</p><p>Avoiding the fastest shrinking jobs may help you enjoy a more secure financial future.

Try a Passive Job Search</strong><br></h1><p></p></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><p></p><p>Even if you're content at your current job, it is always a good idea to keep an eye out for better positions. Doing so doesn't require much effort, and you never know what kinds of opportunities you will discover. Here are some tips to help you with your passive job search.<br></p> <h3>The Advantages of Passive Job Search</h3> <p>According to the human resources publication<a href=""http://www.tlnt.com/2011/03/08/survey-74-of-workers-are-passive-job-seekers-ready-to-consider-a-move/"">TLNT</a>, although the majority of workers in the U.S. claim to be satisfied with their jobs, research shows that about three quarters of them would switch jobs if a better opportunity came along. Common reasons for changing jobs include better pay and benefits, more advancement opportunities and a desire for change. <br></p> <p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2012/08/14/job-hopping-is-the-new-normal-for-millennials-three-ways-to-prevent-a-human-resource-nightmare/"">Forbes</a> reports that most Millennials, those who were born between 1977 and 1997, expect to stay at the same job for less than three years. They might go through 15 or more jobs throughout their lifetimes. Because job-hopping is becoming common, recruiters are beginning to see it as a sign of ambition among applicants who are not willing to settle for a job that doesn't leave them fulfilled.<br></p> <h3>How to Start Passively Look for a Job </h3> <p>Be discreet. You don't want to risk losing your current position by allowing your boss or co-workers to find out about your job search. For this reason, any activities you conduct should be anonymous. Websites like <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> make it easy for you to set up e-mail job alerts for one or many positions. Just be sure to check these emails at home or on your personal cell phone.</p><p></p><p> </p><h3>Use Social Media for Your Search <br></h3> <p>As you wait for the right position to open, you should track companies you would love to work for. Reading their social media updates can give you some insight into the company, including whether there are job openings. Just remember not to show your interest publicly, such as by commenting on job listings, since your current employer could see it. <br></p> <p>In addition, the<a href=""http://www.careereducation.columbia.edu/resources/tipsheets/finding-job-using-social-media-intro"">Columbia University Center for Career Education</a> recommends that you keep your social media profiles updated at all times. This is an effective method for catching the eye of recruiters. And this way, you do not have to scramble to update your information once your passive job search begins, which could tip off your current employer. <br></p> <h3>Take Advantage of Anonymous Settings on Job Boards <br></h3> <p>One of the easiest ways to search passively is to post your resume on job boards. This only requires a few minutes of your time, and it could lead to a company finding you. Of course, make sure your resume cannot be seen by the public. Private settings on job boards remove your name and other identifying information, ensuring that recruiters only see your skills and experience before contacting you through the board to learn more. <br></p> <h3>Network with People You Know <br></h3> <p>One final tip: leverage your network of professional contacts and acquaintances during your passive job search. Of course, your coworkers and boss should be exempt from this group. But if you have friends who often rave about their jobs, there's no harm in asking them to let you know each time their company is hiring. Also, if you belong to an alumni association or a professional group for people in your industry, simply staying in touch and discussing careers is an easy way to hear about the latest job openings.</p>"Career,5 Resume Mistakes Lots of People Make,"<h1>5 Resume Mistakes Many People Make</h1><p>Common resume mistakes often extend beyond simple typos. If you aren't getting results with your resume, it might be because your resume has problems that you can't see but that a hiring manager can. Here are some examples of mistakes that spell-check won't fix. <br></p> <h3>Too Generic </h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505143_162-57553977/dumb-mistakes-smart-people-make-on-resumes/"">CBS News</a>, many resumes are not specific enough. For example, they might clearly be copied and pasted straight from a template. While looking at a template is a fine place to start, you will want to improve on it and personalize as much as possible. Also, if the position you are applying for requires some creativity, you can show creativity in the format of your resume.</p><p>The content of the document should be as specific as possible. Make sure you incorporate some of the responsibilities listed in the job ad. You want to make it clear that not only are you a great fit for the job, but you also cared enough to take the time to personalize your resume for this company.  <br></p> <h3>Wrong Information</h3> <p>You only have a page or two to show what you can do for an employer. Don't waste space with extraneous information. According to <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/03/28/10-mistakes-youre-making-on-your-resume"">U.S. News & World Report</a>, you do not need to list all of the jobs you have had, especially if they were several years ago or have nothing to do with the job you want. Just list those that are relevant or, failing that, recent. Leave out information that the company does not need to know. This includes facts about your family or special skills that do not relate to your career or your salary history. <br></p> <h3>Lack of Good Information </h3> <p>Don't sell yourself short when you write your resume. This is the place to list any certifications, awards and skills you have, provided they relate to the job you want. If you are fluent in a second language, received an award for most valuable new employee at your last job or performed hours of volunteer work while unemployed, make sure you mention these achievements. <br></p> <h3>Experience Instead of Achievements </h3> <p>Employers want to know what you can do well, not just your past job duties. That's why <a href=""http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/career-management/10-resume-mistakes-to-avoid/"">TechRepublic</a> advises that you mention how you were able to overcome challenges and how previous employers benefited from your work. For example, instead of saying you ordered office supplies for the company at which you worked, list how much money you were able to save your employer by negotiating a better rate with the vendor. This is far more impressive to employers. <br></p> <h3>Inconsistencies</h3> <p>You have probably proofread your resume for grammar and spelling mistakes, but that doesn't mean you caught all of the inconsistencies in the document. <a href=""http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2286-resume-mistakes.html"">Business News Daily</a> recommends that you make sure that the company names, titles and work dates you have listed are correct. Otherwise, employers might be confused or even suspicious that you provided inaccurate information about these details.</p>"Career,What Companies Look for During Job Interviews,"<h1><b>What Interviewers Look For During Job Interviews</b></h1><p>You polished your resume, wrote a brilliant cover letter and landed the interview. The company recognizes that you are qualified enough to meet with its hiring manager, so what will it take to land the job? Employers look at three ""P's""during job interviews: presentation, preparation and personality. Follow the steps below to exceed your interviewers expectations and win the job you want. </p><h3><b>Presentation</b></h3><p>You are not going to be offered a job based on what you wear or how you look, but your appearance could take you out of the running as a viable candidate. As soon as you walk into the room, the interviewer will take notice of your overall appearance. Are your clothes clean and pressed? Is your hair neatly styled? Applicants should wear professional clothing that matches or exceeds the atmosphere of the workplace. Jewelry, if any, should be understated and complementary to the outfit. Showing up to a job interview looking sloppy, rumpled or messy will definitely cause an interviewer to think less of your capabilities as an employee.</p><p>Interviewers will notice if you look uncomfortable or nervous. Try to be mindful of the image you are projecting with your body. Do not glance at your watch or the door, avoid nervous habits such as playing with your hair or jewelry, and try not to fidget. Job applicants should strive to project confidence during an interview. Sit up straight, lean slightly forward, make eye contact with the interviewer and show that you are engaged in the conversation with your body. <br></p><h3><b>Preparation</b></h3><p>The most important quality that interviewers want to see is that a candidate prepared for the interview. Show the interviewer that you have a good understanding of what the company does. <a href=""http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/10-things-job-applicants-should-know/"">Research </a>the company, read its website and find out what makes them stand out. Additionally, interviewers want to know that you understand the position for which you are applying. Re-read the job posting, and be sure that you can prove to the interviewer that you have most, if not all, of the qualities for which the company is looking.<br></p><p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/jobs/before-the-job-interview-do-your-homework.html?_r=1&"">Prepare </a>for possible interview questions the interviewer may ask. Search for sample interview questions prior to the job interview, and think about how you would answer them. Interviewers want to see that you are cool, calm and collected under pressure, especially if the interview questions are designed to be difficult or tricky. Take time to think about your answers before speaking, and try not to ramble. If you can create a well-reasoned, coherent response that actually answers the question and frames you in a positive light, the interviewer will be impressed with your poise.</p><h3><b>Personality</b></h3><p>Interviewers want to know that you are a good fit for the company and its current employees. While your personality isnt really something you can change, being personable and carrying on a conversation can go a long way towards showing an interviewer that you belong in this position. Research your interviewer on LinkedIn or Google to see what you can learn about them, and have a conversation starter prepared. Also, speak with friends and family who may know the company with which you are interviewing, and find out what the atmosphere is like. Are they a prestigious, buttoned-down firm, a fun-loving Internet startup or something in between? Tailor your conversation and approach with the interviewer to the atmosphere of the company, and the interviewer will be more likely to decide that you belong at the company. </p><p><a></a>By focusing your energy on being presentable, prepared and personable, you can show your interviewer that you are best candidate for the job. </p><p><br></p>"Job Search Tips,How to Know it's Time to Leave Your Job,"<h1>6 Signs Its Time to Leave Your Job</h1> <p>Most people polled say they'd leave their current job for a better one if the opportunity arose. Theres a big difference, however, between feeling like youd rather be elsewhere and longing to cut and run from a job youve come to hate. Whether you have outgrown your workplace, or, worse yet, worn out your welcome, here are six signs that it might be time to leave your job.</p> <h3>Youre Unhappy</h3> <p>There are different ways to be unhappy at work. From time to time, all of us feel (and probably are) unappreciated, overworked and unduly stressed. If, however, you consistently feel like you cant do anything right, that nothing you do will please anyone, and that help, even if asked for, will never be forthcoming, then things are getting out of control.</p> <h3>Your Boss is Unhappy</h3> <p>Supervisors can seem dissatisfied for a variety of reasons. They may be overworked, frustrated or stressed out. Unfortunately, because none of us are perfect, your boss might also be the sort of person who doesnt have very good people skills. If your boss seems perpetually unhappy, you should find out whether the dissatisfaction is with you, with others or with the entire staff. If you feel like youre the one he or she is unhappy with, then its time for a private talk. If youre being targeted in an unfair manner, then its time to go.</p> <h3>You Feel Like Youre at a Dead End</h3> <p><a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/05/10/16-signs-its-time-to-quit-your-job"">If you feel like your job represents a nightmare tunnel with no discernible end</a>, and if these overwhelmingly negative feelings persist day after day, then you probably need a change. You dont need to be exuberantly passionate about what youre doing every single day, but you also shouldnt dread coming in to work every morning.</p> <h3>You Feel Sick a Lot</h3> <p>If you think your job may be bad for your health, you may be right. Feeling sick and depressedeven to the point where you need to take days offmay be a signal that the stress, fatigue and negative environment are playing havoc with your physical health.</p> <h3>You No Longer Like Your Company</h3> <p>If you started your job with enthusiasm, only to emerge disillusioned, disappointed and totally lacking in respect or regard for your company, then chances are its going to be impossible to rekindle that spark.<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/09/04/14-signs-its-time-to-leave-your-job/""> If you cant respect the place for which you work, then you cant respect yourself for working there</a>, which means its time to look for a way out.</p> <h3>You Feel Taken for Granted</h3> <p>We all feel taken for granted at work, but if you feel that your skills are neither appreciated nor used, then you should investigate why this is happening. If youre not satisfied with the answer, then its probably time to go.</p> <p>If you relate strongly with several of these signs, then it might be time to start dusting off the resume. Before you decide to leave your job, however, its important to make sure that youve made an honest attempt to succeed. If possible, open up lines of communication with your supervisors and make a list of pros and cons before you make your final decision.</p><p>While youre still deciding, its a good idea to take a look at job sites such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>to see what the current market is like. If communicating with your supervisors doesnt change anything, and you can affordfrom both a financial and a career perspectiveto go, then start lining up interviews before you give notice so that youll be a few steps ahead of the game.</p>"Resumes,When Should College Students Start Their Job Search?,"<h1><b>When Should College Students Start their Job Search? </b></h1> <p>Senior year of college is an exciting and busy time, and it goes by fast. College students should prepare for graduation by starting their job searches early. How early? Earlier than you think. Experts agree that the earlier that students look for jobs, the better luck they will have finding a job before graduation. Here is a timeline for what college students should do to increase their chances of being hired after graduation.</p> <h3><b>Freshman, Sophomore and Junior Years</b></h3> <p>It is never too <a href=""http://www.hartwick.edu/academics/majors-and-minors/social-sciences/economics/economics-career-planning/finding-a-job/job-search-timeline"">early </a>to start your job search. One of the most important things college students can do to secure a job after graduation is to find internships related to their chosen filed. Not only will an internship help students decide if their chosen career is right for them, but a successful internship can lead to a job offer after graduation. Contacts made during an internship can prove invaluable for finding a job later in your college career. </p> <h3><b>Senior Year: 9 Months Before Graduation</b></h3> <p>When you arrive at college for your senior year, sign up with your career center to get the latest updates on career fairs and on-campus job interviews. Many employers start recruiting students in the fall, and they accept applications for interviews that happen in January and February. Dont miss an opportunity to interview with these employers. Spend your fall semester applying for as many job opportunities as possible. During your senior year you should try to <a href="" http://www.quintcareers.com/senior_year_success.html"">strengthen </a>your resume by joining groups or taking leadership positions in groups where you are already a member.</p> <h3><b>Senior Year: 6 Months Before Graduation</b></h3> <p>Soon after the school year starts, many majors and career fields will begin having career fairs at your school. Attend these fairs to get an idea of which employers are recruiting new graduates, and make a list of potential companies you'd like to work for. Keep applying to as many companies as possible. </p> <h3><b>Senior Year: 4 Months Before Graduation</b></h3> <p>Around January or February, employers start interviewing students who sent in applications the previous fall. Many career centers have practice interviews set up to assist students. Use these resources to make sure your interviews are as polished as possible. Attend all interviews to which you are invited; even if you do not want to work for a particular company, the practice will be beneficial. Additionally, start collecting references and letters of recommendation from your professors. Your professors will be more willing to write you letters and will have more substantial things to say about you if you ask them for recommendations while you are still taking their classes. </p> <h3><b>After Graduation and Beyond</b></h3> <p>If you have not secured a job in the last few months prior to graduation, dont give up! It can sometimes take months to receive a job offer. After graduation, update your resume. Get a final copy of your transcript from the registrar, and keep applying! </p> <p>Filling out job applications, sending out resumes and finding a job as a college student can be stressful. Eventually, your job search efforts will pay off, and you will have a new career to go along with your new degree! Stay positive, dont give up hope, and success will soon be yours.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2><br></h2>"Resumes,Pepper Your Resume with the Right Keywords,"<h2>Pepper Your Resume with the Right Keywords</h2><p>Your resume is a powerful marketing tool that can land you the interview you need to get the job you want. Unfortunately, if your resume is missing the right keywords, it might never be seen by human eyes.</p><h3>Why Are Keywords Important?</h3><p>Ken Moore of <a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9228162/Your_resume_Getting_past_the_machines"">Computerworld</a>says, ""Resume keywords are the phrases in a resume that HR screeners, recruiters, hiring managers and, most critically, automated applicant tracking systems (ATS), look for during the initial round of vetting candidates for specific job openings.""</p><p>That last bit is important. Many companies use software to eliminate resumes before anyone ever sees them. A perfectly qualified candidate might be eliminated because of a lack of keywords.</p><p>This makes the inclusion of keywords an essential component of your resume-writing process. Thats why the <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323949404578314220242353956.html""><i>Wall Street Journal</i>s</a> Dennis Nishi wrote, ""On top of genuinely qualifying for the job, you have to be able to back the right keywords with substance while also providing a resume thats readable to humans.""</p><h3>Where Do You Find the Keywords You Need?</h3><p>Some keywords are specific to an industry. Others are applicable only to a certain line of work. So how do you ensure your resume has the right keywords? Each position you apply for is unique. If you customize your resume to the specific position, using the keywords the recruiter uses in the job advertisement, you can target your resume to the employer.</p><p>Nishi also <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323949404578314220242353956.html"">wrote</a>, ""The job posting will provide many verbs, nouns and job-specific terms that youll need to echolike Adobe CS fluency and Cisco certification or actionable phrases that you can key off of like conceive and execute, results driven, visual thinker and punctual and prompt.""</p><p>By pulling your keywords straight from the job advertisement, youll highlight the qualities that companies are looking for. To target a specific employer, however, you should take it one step further and surf the companys website. There you can find additional keywords your prospective employers use to describe their organizations, the work they do and the culture they have created. While the computer program may or may not care about those keywords, the manager looking to hire a new employee will.</p><h3>How Do You Use Keywords in Your Resume?</h3><p>Moore <a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9228162/Your_resume_Getting_past_the_machines"">says</a>, ""Automated tracking systems are pretty smart. You must use keywords in the proper context, or the ATS might ignore your resume."" You should also use keywords throughout your resume to show that they werent simply an afterthought. Using keywords isnt enough; you have to use them well.</p><p>Have you ever heard the phrase ""keyword stuffing?"" Its used to describe online content that is created for search engines without consideration of whether the copy is readable. The same mistake can be made in creating a resume.</p><p><a></a>The ATS is only a first line of defense. Once you get past the computers, you still have to win the interest of the hiring manager. Keywords arent enough by themselvesa well-written resume that tells a good story is keybut, without keywords you might never get the chance to be heard.</p><p></p>"Interviews,How to End a Job Interview on a Positive Note,"<h1>How to End a Job Interview on a Positive Note</h1><p>You've submitted your resume and cover letter and have been called for a job interview. If you're like most applicants, you're at least a little nervous about the interview. Here's a tip that might help. Finish up strong. End the interview on a positive note to maximize your first impression. As they say in showbiz, leave 'em wanting more.</p><h3>Show Off What You Know About the Company</h3><div>One thing that interviewing managers love is a candidate who has done their research. The moment you receive notice about an interview, intensify your research in the company. This means going online and reading the company website. Start with the ""About the Company"" and ""News"" sections. Jot down important facts, such as when the company was organized, how big it is, what it does, what its goals and motto are and what news it has announced publicly. Make sure to bring this up in the interview when it is natural to do so.<br><br></div><div>If at the end of the interview you're asked the question, ""What can you bring to our company?"" or ""Why should we hire you over another candidate?"" work some of the company's own information into your answer. For example, if the company has earned an award for Best Software Sales Team, you could say something about your hard work and your belief that you can use your skills and dedication to help attain the Best Software Sales Team award next year.</div><h3>Ask a Good Question</h3><div>Sometimes the interviewing manager will ask if you have any questions at the end of the interview. The <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/jobs/features/2007/interview-survival-kit/finish_strong.html""><i>Washington Post</i></a> recommends asking away. Use this as an opportunity to win over the interviewer. You can ask a basic question such as, ""What's a typical workday like?""This not only highlights your interest in the job, but it also shows interest in the company.</div><div></div><div><a href=""https://www.devex.com/en/news/finish-strong-how-to-end-a-job-interview-on-a-positive-note/76854"">Devex</a>recommends asking questions that show you've done your research on the company. An example Devex provided for guidance is: ""I noticed in your annual report that fundraised income increased by 11 percent last year and it was private donations as opposed to large corporate sponsorship that drove this change. Can you tell me more about that?"" A hiring manager is going to love you at this moment.<br></div><h3>Discuss Your Skills After the Interview</h3><div>As the end of the interview draws near, remind the interviewer of your skills. This way your skills will be fresh in their memory. Here's one way you can integrate this information into the closing conversation:</div><div></div><div>If you're asked, ""Do you have anything you wish to add before we conclude?"" Answer with, "" Yes, do you feel my skills in _____ and _____ would make me a successful candidate for the interview?""<br></div><div><br></div><div>Now, you may be nervous about asking this question, but it's surprising useful. Not only is it a good way to remind the interviewer of your skills, but it also shows that you really care about getting the job. Bonus: You'll gain some insight into what the company is thinking and whether you have a shot.<br></div><div><h3>Close with Good Etiquette</h3><div>In addition to addressing the interviewer using formal salutations, always end the interview politely. Allow the interviewer to stand up before you do. Make eye contact. Shake hands. The <a href=""http://work.chron.com/end-job-interviews-17223.html"">HoustonChronicle</a>recommends saying ""thank you for considering me"" at the end of the interview.</div><div><br></div><div>And don't forget the all-important thank-you note:<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2013/08/26/job-seekers-no-the-interview-thank-you-note-is-not-dead/"">Forbes</a> says that a company is 22 percentless likely to hire a person who doesn't send a thank you letter. The business publicationrecommends including the following in a thank you letter:<br></div></div><div><br></div><div><ul><li>The hiring managers name</li><li>The title of the open position</li><li>Something specific about the interview or important items discussed</li><li>Your interest in the position</li><li>Your appreciation for their time (the ""thank you"" part)</li><li>Your recognition of the next steps in the hiring process</li><li>Your contact information</li></ul><div>Experts recommend sending it within 24 hours by email or post.</div></div><div><br>There you have it. You don't have to put on a show to end your interview on a positive note. Just pay attention, ask questions related to the business, include your interviewer and be cordial and polite.

Within your current role, it can mean being willing to change with the tides and undertake tasks that aren't necessarily in your job description in order to help your company run more efficiently. It also means being willing to reconsider the career ladder as more of a career web, branching out in several directions instead of going straight up. Considering your career path as more of a web enables you try different jobs in order to gain a broader expertise and prepares you for other options in the future. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/meghanbiro/2013/08/18/5-reasons-why-workplace-flexibility-is-smart-talent-strategy/"">For employers, </a>flexibility means allowing more breathing room for employees to telecommute and to work alternate schedules than the standard 8-to-5, increasing employee morale and opening the doors for more growth with a wider hiring pool. Overall, flexibility is being able to bend the rigid confines of a job role to best suit the needs of everyone involved. <br></p><p></p> <h3><b>Statistically Speaking</b></h3> <p>Did you know that <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/strategicconsulting/163007/state-american-workplace.aspx"">over 70</a>percentof people are currently dissatisfied or ""actively disengaged"" with their jobs? Thats probably why, according to the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/nlsoy.pdf"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the average person changes jobs about <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/nlsoy.pdf"">11 times</a> during their career. You dont have to be part of the unhappy majority. Recent studies also show the average person changes jobs every <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/tenure.pdf"">4.6 years</a>, and according to a study by <a href=""http://www.futureworkplace.com"">Future Workplace</a>, 91 percent of Millennials expect to stay in their jobs for less than three years. </p> <p>So, what do these statistics mean for you? They mean that between a dodgy economy and an ever-shifting workforce youll have more opportunities for growth, change, flexibility and transition than ever before. As more people are switching paths and trying new things, there is more room for others to do the same. </p> <p>This trend also means that people who are masters at multiple skills will become more valuable than ever in their current roles. Employers will need to be more accommodating to those who have skills in demand. In an environment where employees no longer feel a long-term commitment to their jobs and are more willing to leave in search of better opportunities, employers must be prepared to bend to meet the needs of their workers in order to make them happy enough to stay.</p> <h3><b>Where to Go from Here</b></h3> <p>Flexibility in your career opens the doors for new opportunities to grow, flourish and learn.

When used correctly, keywords mean the difference between spending hours in search of good jobs or finding them efficiently.</p><p>To understand how it all works, put yourself in the shoes of the companies posting the jobs. These companies employ keywords in the hopes of finding the most qualified candidates for open positions.

With such massive opportunity, many companies give a lot of thought to their keyword usage.Relevant terms are not only placed in the heading of every listing but also strategically within the job description and company description. Employers focus their efforts on the text that goes into each advertised position, and their goal is to choose between three and five separate terms or phrases to market these jobs.</p><p>To choose key terms, companies typically run through a set of questions and perform a series of their own searches to come up with the most popular terms.</p><p>For example, they ask themselves the following:</p><ul><li> Which keywords are most relevant to the position we're offering?</li><li>Which are the most searched keywords or terms in relation to the type of job we're posting?</li><li>How do we verify or research these terms to be sure they are the most relevant?</li></ul><p>With the first two questions, the idea is to brainstorm and create a list of possible keywords that will produce the best results.

What Should I Do?</h1><div><p>So you've found the perfect job opportunity, and you can't wait to attach your resume and cover letter and click send. However, there's one problem: You became so excited that you had attached your resume and submitted it before double-checking the spelling, and you realize you overlooked a typo.</p><p>At this point, you're probably thinking, ""Oh, no. Now I'll never get the job."" Or: ""They'll probably think I don't have a good eye for detail."" Whatever you do, don't send that apology email just yet. There's no need to panic. You can fix this error. If you submitted your resume and realized that there's a glaring typo on it, there are a few things you can do about it.</p><h3>Leave It Be:Don't Fret Over Punctuation Errors</h3></div><div>If your resume contained a punctuation error, such as a missing period or a misplaced comma, chances are the person reading your resume won't even notice. According to advice from<a href=""http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/you-found-errors-in-your-resume-after-sending-it-to-an-employer-now-what-HA010167314.aspx"">Microsoft,</a>which creates popular resume templates,minor errors such as these are not worth worrying over, but you should update and edit your resume and save the new version.</div><h3>Resend It if There Are Large Errors</h3><div>If you have many errors on your resume, or if you have one egregious typo such as the company's name, it's best to resend the resume. Hoping the recruiter won't see a glaring typo is like wishing that your resume was eaten by email goblins. (It's highly unlikely). The right thing you can do in this situation is to simply resend your resume, along with a cover letter, explaining that you have attached an updated version. You can write something along the lines of:</div><div><br></div><div>""I am very interested in working for your company, and therefore, I want to make sure that you have the most current version of my resume.""</div><div><br></div><div>Whatever you do, don't admit that your typo was an oversight. Some companies use software to sort and store resumes. This software updates when it receives a new version automatically, so chances are the company might never see the old one if you send the new version quickly enough.</div><h3>Resend It andApologize if You're Contacted</h3><div>Every so often a company will be nice enough to call you and point out a typo on your resume. If this happens, they'll usually ask for an updated one. This shows a clear interest in you as a candidate for the job, so apologize and resend the resume. Do not over-apologize, though. Just resend the resume, and write in the subject line, ""Updated Resume.""<a href=""http://www.payscale.com/career-news/2013/04/so-you-made-a-typo-on-your-resume.-now-what-"">Pay Scale</a> advises re-sending the resume without adding any information in the email admitting the typo or says not to use the word ""fixed.""</div><div><br></div><div>As you can see, sending a resume with a typo isn't the end of the world. Decide whether the error is significant enough to warrant a new email or minor enough to ignore. Whatever the case may be, fix the error right away and make sure the new version is the only one remaining. If the error isn't discovered online but in your interview instead, be prepared with an updated copy of your edited resume. If the interviewing manager points out the error in the interview, politely apologize and hand over the updated version. Politeness trumps mistakes at the end, and they're likely to overlook the typo if they're interest.</div>"Interviews,How to Answer 'Tell Me More About Yourself',"<h1><b>How To Answer 'Tell Me More About Yourself' in a Job Interview</b></h1><p></p><p></p><p>You might dread it, but when the ""tell me more about yourself"" question is asked during a job interview, it's an opportunity to shine. The question comes up in most interviews, and you don't want to answer it slack-jawed; it's well worth the time to prepare for this moment.<br></p><p>Sometimes the interviewer will start the interview with this question. Otherwise the question will arrive later. It is used to gauge how applicants see themselves, to pull the kind of information that wouldn't be received from a direct question and, perhaps above all, to see if the candidates are actually prepared.</p><p></p><p>If you do prepare, this shouldn't be a difficult question for you. According to Marc Cenedella of TheLadders, who used to conduct hiring interviews, <a href=""http://www.theladders.com/career-advice/how-to-answer-tell-me-about-yourself-interview-question"">the worst response is to ask back, ""What do you want to know?""</a>This shows that you didn't expect the question and might not be serious about the job.</p><p></p><p>Prepare an answer and practice it until it sounds good. Your answer should focus on making your personality and your skills look like a good match for the company.</p><p>Here are some more suggestions for answering the ""Tell me more about yourself"" interview question.<br></p><h3><b>Avoid sharing mundane personal information</b></h3>The interviewer doesn't really care about where you were born or grew up. When you are asked to tell the interviewer about yourself, you're not being asked about your demographics. He or she wants to learn more about your professional experience. How can you benefit the company? What makes you qualified and able to do the job? What makes you different?<br><h3><b>Begin with credentials</b></h3>These aspects of your life are simpler and easier to remember and can help get the ball rolling. Practically anything you say will sound better with your official accreditation right at the front.<br><h3><b>Highlight your most memorable achievements</b></h3>Take the time beforehand to study up on yourself, and pinpoint the times when you have shown leadership, confidence, a good work ethic, the ability to work under pressure and other relevant workplace scenarios.<br><h3><b>Don't ramble</b></h3>Say what you planned to say, and don't include the too-personal details you would tell your friends. It's OK to take a moment to think; but don't create a long, awkward silence. Don't go on and on either. When you're done, you're done. About one minute is a good length of time for a response.<br><h3><b>Explain why you are interested in the job</b></h3>In all likelihood, many people can do the job for which you are applying. The interviewer wants to know how you are different from the other candidates, and <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/04/30/how-to-answer-tell-me-about-yourself-in-a-job-interview"">a good way to approach this is to talk about why you personally are interested in this career</a>. Find a way to make your interests fit the job position, if needs be, and never give the impression that you are just doing it for the money.<br><h3><b>Tell a story</b></h3>Stories help to explain your motivations and showcase your abilities in a real-life scenario. They also engage the interviewer personally and get them interested in what you are talking about. Even if you have no work experience that is directly relevant to the job, you can still tell a story about how you overcame a particularly challenging problem, led a group of people successfully or had a major positive impact on a company.<br><h3><b>Avoid cliches</b></h3>The interviewer knows all the buzzwords that applicants use to describe themselvesbetter than the applicants do. <a href=""http://jobs.theguardian.com/article/4170846/common-interview-questions/"">Many words sound trite and rehearsed</a>, as if the applicant has a list of them ready to go, and the interviewer has heard these phrases many times, which is why their eyes are glossing over. Don't say things like, ""I'm a team player,"" ""I have a strong work ethic"" or ""I follow instructions well and can work independently."" Instead, demonstrate these qualities by telling stories and providing personal examples.<p></p><p>The next time you are asked to ""tell me more about yourself"", you know what to do. Share your credentials, demonstrate your abilities and interests and explain what you have achieved in the past.</p>"Career,The Mid-Career Internship,"<h1><b>The Mid-Career Internship</b></h1> <p>Whether you have been out of the workforce for a while or in the same line of work for years, you might feel like it is time to start something new. Mid-career internships are becoming a more common way for established professionals to take their careers in a new direction. In fact, <a href=""http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?id=pr582&sd=8%2F11%2F2010&ed=12%2F31%2F2010"">a Career Builder survey</a>found that 23 percent of employers have seen an increase in experienced and mature workers apply for internships. Should you consider a mid-career internship? Here's some info to help you make the decision.</p> <h3><b>Taking the Leap</b></h3> <p>Making the decision to start over can be overwhelming. Leaving your career to begin an internship in a different field means taking a significant pay cut. Even leaving your job temporarily might signal to your current employer that you're no longer enthusiastic about your job. Theres also the fear of the unknown, of starting from scratch and of taking orders from someone younger. Prepare yourself.</p> <h3><b>The Transition</b></h3> <p>Returning to work after a long period of unemployment can pose challenges. If you are coming back to the workplace, an internship might then be a good option. Youll be able to establish or re-establish yourself in your industry and apply for full-time jobs with a fresh new outlook and the added value of recent experience. <br></p><p>If you already have a full-time job then you have several options. You can work part-time temporarily and make time for the internship on top of your job. You can use vacation time, if you have enough time saved. Or you can take a leave of absence or quit your job and focus completely on your new career.</p> <h3><b>Getting In</b></h3> <p>While you have many options for finding an internship, one tried and true method is to go through a formal internship program while talking classes at a local college. Colleges are able to help students with internships, and most offer job placement services. Because you're attending school, you will bring with you the credibility of the institution. It looks good. You have educated yourself and learned a new skill.</p><p>If going to school is not an option, you can find internships through job search engines such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/a/jobs/list/q-internships"">Simply Hired.</a></p><p></p> <h3><b>Adaptation</b></h3> <p>The conventional wisdom is that middle-aged people arent as flexible at changing jobs as younger people. Youre going to have to dispel that notion. Be flexible and engaged. Ask questions. Make the most out of every moment as an intern so you are able to secure the best possible job after your term is over.</p> <h3><b>Regarding Pay</b></h3> <p>You might not be paid, but it still might be worth it. Unpaid internships are legal as long as they are with a non-profit organization, or if they're acquired through school-sponsored programs (as mentioned above). Private sector companies are only allowed to offer unpaid internships <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/whd/"">if they meet six criteria</a>:</p> <p></p><ul><li>Training must be comparable to an educational environment<br></li><li>Experience benefits the intern<br></li><li>Intern does not replace a regular employee<br></li><li>Employer does not immediately benefit from interns role<br></li><li>No guarantee of employment after internship<br></li><li>Mutual understanding that the intern will not be paid</li></ul> <h3><b>Ready to Find an Internship?</b></h3> <p>Taking on a mid-career internship is an opportunity to test drive a new path or expand your current skill set. It will give you the chance to branch out and meet new people, and it can win you valuable experience. When youre ready to get more out of your work, weigh your options. An internship might be just what you need to start transforming your career.</p> <p><br></p>"Job Search Tips,How to Find Out if a Company is Hiring,"<h1>How to Find Out if a Company is Hiring</h1><p>If you have a particular company that you would like to work for, you might have wondered where to begin. What's the first step in walking through that one exciting door? Below are ways that you can discover whether a company is currently hiring.</p><h3>Company Website</h3><p>This should be your first stop in researching job possibilities at a specific company. Not only are you likely to find current openings listed (look for a ""careers"" or ""employment"" page), but you can also learn a lot about other aspects of the company. Its essential to be knowledgeable about a business before applying and to have some thoughtful questions prepared when you speak to a manager.</p><h3>LinkedIn</h3><p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/"">LinkedIn</a>s business pages are a great place to check for open positions because they contain valuable network information in addition to job listings. If you have a LinkedIn profile (and you should!) you will see the connections you have with everyone at your target company. Even if you don't personally know anyone there, you may find that you have an acquaintance in common. <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-boucher/linkedin-and_b_3897093.html"">Huffington Post</a> writer Jason Boucher advises being very active on LinkedIn by joining groups, making plenty of comments and publishing articles or research. He also urges job seekers to be highly selective in their contacts, culling those that appear less professional.</p><h3>Word of Mouth</h3><p>Check with everyone you know, and ask them if they know anyone who works for your target company. Its always best if you have personal connections to someone in a business because hiring managers always prefer individuals who are already known to be trustworthy.</p><p>Call your local Chamber of Commerce, and ask them if they are aware of companies in your area that are hiring. In mid-sized and smaller towns, someone in the Chamber has often heard of potential job openings that arent publicized yet. They might even be able to give you a contact name within the company. You can then call that person with a few questions about the company and ask what the best way is to apply.</p><p><a

</a>recommends that you also dont stop at one connection. If you need to, speak with someone in a different department.</p><h3>Twitter</h3><p>Follow your target companies on <a href=""https://twitter.com/"">Twitter</a>. Theres a real person behind the Twitter account, and if you comment and re-tweet what they post, theyll begin to notice you. They might mention a job, or (after a while, when the person writing the Twitter posts knows who you are) you can ask about openings. Of course, its crucial that your Twitter profile be completely professional before engaging in this type of conversation.</p><h3>Newsletters</h3><p>A great insider tip is to seek out industry and alumni newsletters. These circulate among people who already have connections with one another, and they often include early notices of job openings--just another demonstration of the fact that employers love to find job candidates with whom they already feel connected.</p><p>A good example of an industry newsletter is <a href=""http://www.minonline.com/"">Media in the News</a>. This free online publication provides a rich blend of chat, links, trends and job openings; you can scroll down to the right and see a short list of jobs, and you can also look in the top navigation bar for the ""media jobs"" tab. No matter what industry you're interested in, you'll be able to find an industry-specific newsletter. (Try Googling the name of your industry with the word ""newsletter."")</p><p>You should also stay up to date with your college and high school's alumni associations. These associations usually publish online magazines or newsletters, and they are often interconnected through LinkedIn as well. They may offer connections for all alumni to make use of their career centers, like this alumni page for <a href=""https://www.csunalumni.com/default.aspx?Page=CareerResources"">Cal State Northridge</a> does, and they give you a way to stay in touch with classmates who are involved in your field.<br></p><h3>Job Boards</h3><p>Online job boards are a great way to check on which companies are hiring. Sites such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> offer the ability to search for all openings in a particular company, and this search can also be narrowed to cover only a particular region. Simply Hired also allows you to easily create a job alert, so that if the company you're interested in posts a new job, you'll be notified right away. Remember that businesses are as interested in finding you as you are in finding them because their prosperity depends on attracting fresh talent.</p>"Interviews,"Resume Length: The Shorter, The Better","<p></p><div><div><h1>Resume Length: The Shorter, The Better</h1><p></p></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><p></p><p>How long is a proper resume? The typical response to this question is that it should be one to two pages, though there are some exceptions to this general guideline. If you are still iffy on the importance of sticking to the shorter side when it comes to resume length, read on to discover the reasons behind this rule and the exceptions.<br></p> <h3>Long Resumes Lose the Reader's Interest <br></h3> <p>The main reason you are better off with a shorter resume is that you want to make sure the resume actually gets read. Considering that employers receive hundreds or even thousands of resumes for each position, it is unlikely that a document with multiple pages will be read thoroughly, if at all. <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/01/03/5-commonly-asked-resume-questions"">U.S. News & World Report</a> suggests that recent graduates without much work experience stick to one-page resumes, while longer work histories should typically take up two pages maximum. <br></p> <h3>The Important Details Can Get Lost in Long Resumes <br></h3> <p><a href=""http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/11/08/4-reasons-resumes-are-rejected/"">DailyFinance</a> reminds job seekers that the resume is not supposed to be a listing of every job, award or skill they have ever had. When you list everything, rather than carefully selecting only the crucial details, what's really important gets lost. After all, most employers spend less than 30 seconds scanning each resume. That means the more information you include, the less likely the important facts will be read. Spend some time choosing the most relevant and impressive jobs, skills and details about your education until it all fits into one to two pages. <br></p> <h3>Long Resumes Show Your Age <br></h3> <p>If your resume goes back 30 years, you might be putting yourself at a disadvantage. Unfortunately, many employers these days prefer younger workers. This means they might look at your resume long enough to see when your first job was, but not long enough to notice your strengths. That's why <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/10/09/when-your-resume-looks-like-bad-news/"">Forbes</a> recommends that you only list the jobs you have had in the last 15 years or less. If you really want to mention experience you received decades ago, you can list it at the end of the resume in a section that features your additional experience and expertise. <br></p> <h3>Exceptions to the Rule <br></h3> <p>Like most guidelines, there are a few exceptions to the one about resume length. In some cases, you do need a resume that is longer than two pages. According to <a href=""https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/571/01/"">The OWL at Purdue</a>, senior-level executives might need at least three pages to list their leadership positions and detailed job descriptions. You might even need to mention details about your ethics, overall vision and other characteristics that most other job seekers don't bother with. Also, if you are trying to get a job in the scientific or academic industry, you need room to go into depth about your education, publications, licenses and research or teaching experience. In such cases, fitting it all into one or two pages is not recommended.</p>"Career,The Importance of Smiling During a Job Interview,"<h1>The Importance of Smiling During a Job Interview</h1> <p>If youve ever seen the Broadway musical ""Annie,"" you may remember the hit song, ""Youre Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile."" In todays job market, truer words were never spoken. Human Resources experts agree: if you're not smiling at all during your job interview, you may as well stay home.Here are some pointers for when to smile, when not to smile and how to keep it real.</p> <h2>Keeping it Real</h2> <p>Nothing looks more awkward than a forced, unnatural grin (think amateur beauty pageants). <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/08/20/interview-body-language-mistakes-that-can-cost-you-the-job-2/"">To avoid getting into a deep facial freeze, keep your face as relaxed as possible</a>. Of course, this is hard to do if youre a bundle of nerves, so thats why its crucial to bolster your confidence before you even enter the building. Otherwise, youre liable to be intimidated by everyone from the doorman to the lobby receptionist.</p> <p>Its important to smile sincerely, but in order to do this, you have to convince yourself that you really want to smile. Otherwise, it wont come naturally. Think lighthearted, amusing and non-distracting thoughts to yourself before the interview. Once it starts, keep noticing positive things, such as comical signs or calendars, attractive colors or lovely flower arrangements. By keeping yourself on a positive keel throughout, youll be able to convince yourself that yes, you really are enjoying yourself. Your smile will reflect this, and few things impresses an interviewer more than a relaxed, confident interviewee whos obviously enjoying the interview process.</p> <h2>Keeping it Subtle</h2> <p>Youve got the smile down pat, but are you afraid you might be overdoing it?</p> <p>Smiling too much can be almost as bad as not smiling at all. For one thing, it will make you look silly, as if you live in your own little world and only occasionally decide to come to Earth and join the human race. This may sound like an exaggeration, but have you ever seen someone standing in the street or on the bus or subway, with a fixed smile on his face, regardless of his surroundings? Do you remember how positively goofy he looked?</p> <p>You dont want to look like that. Instead, keep your smile appropriate to the moment. If your prospective employer is talking about important matters crucial to the industry, keep the smile on hold. Bring it out again, but ever so subtly, at the right moments in the interview. Let the conversation be your guide.</p> <h2>Buff Up Those Pearly Whites</h2> <p>Youre going to want to show yourself off to your best advantage, and this includes your teeth as well. Invest in an over-the-counter teeth whitening kit several days before the interview so that youll have enough time to bleach those pearly whites a few shades lighter. These days, whiter, brighter teeth are a requirement of good grooming. <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-57450010/9-tips-to-prepare-for-a-job-interview/"">Few things look worse than spinach in your teeth</a>, so check your teeth thoroughly before going in for your interview.</p> <p>How much should you be smiling during a job interview? Believe it or not, the original job listing may hold the key to that all-important question. For instance, if youre searching a job site such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired </a>and you find a posting that reads: ""Were looking for people with a bright, positive attitude!"" then take it seriously. Pay attention whenever an employer thinks that a good, positive personality is important enough to be included in a job posting as a criteria for hiring.</p>"Career,Careers: Ask for What You Want (You Might Get It),"<h1>Ask for What You Want (You Might Get It)</h1><p>The job sounds perfect. It's close to your house, and you would enjoy the work. You make it through the interview process without a lot of concern. Your qualifications are top-notch. You have a personal recommendation, and you know that everyone else who interviewed can't even come close.</p><p>Now the company wants to<a href=""http://www.theladders.com/career-newsletters/20-questions-you-need-to-ask-in-a-job-interview""> talk salary</a>. Do you ask for what you want, or do you take what is offered? If you really want to maximize your earnings as you climb your career ladder, you must learn to ask for what you want.</p><p>You might just get it.</p><h3><b>Decide on Your Goal</b></h3><p>When you go into the<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/07/05/30-questions-you-should-and-shouldnt-ask-in-a-job-interview/""> interview</a>, have your salary and benefits package in mind. If you're currently working in a position that is similar to the one for which you're applying, and your compensation is fair, base your comparisons off of that information. Otherwise, talk to peers or consult sources of salary information to see if you're getting paid what you're worth. If you don't think the new company can offer you what you want, such as with a small start-up, see if you can get better benefits. For example, find out if you can work from home for part of the week or get better medical plans with your new position. Decide what it will absolutely take to get you in this job so you don't have to compromise.</p><h3><b>When to Bring it Up</b></h3><p>Your strongest negotiating position occurs when your employer is first to bring up salary, according to<a href=""http://www.theladders.com/career-advice/salary-negotiation-tips-let-employer-make-first-salary-offer"">The Ladders</a>. This way, you aren't coming off as overeager or putting yourself in a position to be taken out of the job running early on. If you suggest a number that's too high before they decide on you for the position, you could cost yourself the job. Instead, wait until after they have formally offered you the job, if possible. You'll start from a position of advantage, because you know they have picked you over other applicants.</p><p>Another school of thought:<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130619143057-52594-responding-to-a-lowball-job-offer"">Liz Ryan, CEO of the Human Workplace</a>, suggests bringing up salary during the second interview round. She believes that this is a good strategy to avoid ending up with a low ball salary offer at the end of the interview process, saving you the time and frustration that occurs when you go through multiple interview rounds only to be disappointed in the end.</p><h3>Strategies for Negotiating Salary</h3><p>There's no one-size-fits-all strategy for negotiating salary. A lot has to do with the strategy that you're comfortable with, the company, the position and the hiring manager or interviewer who is making the offer.</p><p>One popular strategy endorsed by <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-negotiate-your-salary-without-turning-off-employers-2013-8"">Business Insider</a>is to establish two numbers--the preferred salary range and the minimum salary range. If they end up below your minimum salary, you away from the job offer. When you stand up for yourself and your salary needs, you end up earning more respect than rolling over and saying ""OK"" to the first offer that comes your way. The company expects you to negotiate, so you have to play the game to get what you actually want out of the job offer.</p><p><a href=""http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/11/09/salary-negotiation/"">Forbes</a>suggests another tactic: refusing to name any number or naming an absurd number to avoid giving your idea of the salary range. Instead of pigeon-holing yourself into a specific range, you make the employer guess what you're after. They want to avoid low-balling you to the point that you walk away from the offer. Forbes says that when no numbers are named at all, salary offers are higher than normal. Research the standard salary range for the position so you know how much is reasonable to ask for.</p>"Resumes,How Not to Start a Job Search,"<h1>How Not to Start a Job Search</h1>As you look for employment, it's not a bad idea to spend a few minutes running through the basic ""What Not To Do"" rules of looking for work. Keeping these pointers in mind will ensure that a potential employer doesn't eliminate you from consideration on the basis of an error you could have avoided. The following tips are reminders of how not to start your job search.<br><h3><b>Overselling Yourself</b></h3>Western Washington Universitys Career Services Center <a href=""http://www.wwu.edu/careers/docs/Job%20Search%20Dos%20and%20Donts.pdf"">recommends</a> that job seekers avoid including an ""About Me"" section on their resume. Also, dont write your resume in the first person (""I achieved such-and-such""), and dont try to suggest that you accomplished more than you actually did. Its important to keep cover letters factual as well. You can be enthusiastic, but dont make your cover letter longer than one page, and dont suggest youre more important or experienced than you really are. Basically, don't be long-winded and untruthful.<br><h3>Neglecting Your Social Media Profiles</h3>Before you embark on your job search, update your LinkedIn profile to show your full skill set and current employment (even if you're currently volunteering, freelancing or art part-time). This profile is a likely stop for any prospective employer, and it wont reflect well on you if you stopped updating it three years ago. While your Facebook and Twitter accounts dont have to be professional in focus, they do have to project an upstanding, responsible persona. Those photos of you and your college buddies stealing a stop sign or skinny-dipping need to be taken down before they put you out of the job market. <br><h3>Trying to Look Too Creative</h3>When you interview for most business positions, its best to use your own words to convey your unique view of the world; let your appearance demonstrate your understanding of mainstream expectations. Choose clothing that is appropriate and tidy without drawing attention to yourself. Unless you're interviewing for a job in the fashion industry, your clothing and accessories won't add points; if they attract attention, it's rarely positive.<br><h3>Sounding Desperate</h3>Even if your house is about to be repossessed, you cant gain any advantage by mentioning in an interview or cover letter how much you need a job. Potential employers didnt reach their current level of success by confusing employment with charity. They are interested in what YOU can do for THEM, not the other way around. Even if your reasoning is that you need this job so badly that youll work any amount of overtime and youll be the perfect employee, find a way to convey your dedication without making it sound as if youre needy. It may be unfair, but the truth is that financial desperation will communicate instability to an employer and can scare them away.<br><h3>Being Indiscreet if Youre Currently Employed</h3><p>Dont tell co-workers that youre searching for another job. As Forbes <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45lhik/dont-tell-anyone-at-work/"">points out</a>, ""If you tell one person at work that youre looking for a new job, you might as well tell everyone."" Being discreet also means that you don't ask your current supervisor for a reference, you don't use your company computer to look for work and you don't mention anything about job hunting on your social media profiles. The only possible exception to this, they add, is if your boss has already told you that layoffs are planned in the near future and has offered to assist you with your job search. Utilize privacy settings on LinkedIn and on job boards.</p>"Interviews,How to Search for a Job When You Already Have One,"<h3><b>How to Search For a Job When You Already Have One</b></h3> <p align=""center""><b></b></p> <p>If you are currently in a job that youre not happy with, its only natural you want to find something new and fulfilling. Managing a job search while you already have one takes a little work, but people do it every day. Heres what you should know before you start to search for a job.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Be Discreet About Your Search</b></p> <p></p> <p>It goes without saying that you dont <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-find-a-job-when-you-already-have-one-2012-12"">want to broadcast</a> the fact that youre looking to your employer. Even if you are close friends with someone at work, do not share that you are looking for another job. Not only are you increasing the chances of word getting out about your search, but you are also putting that other person in an awkward position. It is much better to remain quiet and be discreet.</p> <p></p> <p>It can be tempting, particularly if you have a desk job, to use your working hours to find a new job. This is bad form and is not recommended. Youll be stressed that someone will find out what youre doing (which they might) and besides, your current employer isnt paying you to look for a job. Stick to off-the-clock hours for your job search. </p> <p></p> <p><b>Utilize Job Alerts</b></p> <p></p> <p>If youre not looking for a job while youre at work, this does not leave you much time to find a job. However, by utilizing job alerts, news feeds and other social feeds, you can find the latest job postings without having to spend hours looking for them. Most career sites now offer the ability to set up job search alerts with your specific area and keywords, and youll be the first to know when a new job becomes available.This will help you manage your search more effectively and make it easier to find the jobs youre actually interested in, rather than having to wade through numerous job postings. </p> <p></p> <p><b>Manage Your Time Appropriately </b></p> <p></p> <p>Avoid the trap of calling in sick or lying to current employers to get extra time off to aid your job search. Instead, utilize your lunch hours for interviews, if you can, or schedule interviews<a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/05/23/how-to-look-for-a-job-when-youre-employed""> during your off hours</a>. Most potentialemployers are going to understand your difficulty if youre currently employed, and they will be willing to work around your schedule.</p><p><strong>Post Your Resume Anonymously</strong></p><p>You obviously don't want to broadcast the fact that you're looking for a new job, so if you areusing job boards to find a new position, make sure you utilize the feature to post your information anonymously. Thislets you to post a resume and allow it to be circulated among employers, but you can choose how much personal information you want to appear. Recruiters using the database will be able to see your experience, but they won't have access to your name or personal data. This will help you avoid potential issues with your current employer. </p><p></p> <p><b>Have a Firm Offer Before Putting in Your Notice</b></p> <p></p> <p>No matter how well you think an interview went, never put in your notice at your current employer until you have a firm, concrete offer for a new job. This reduces the potential for embarrassment if the new job falls through and you end up desperate for a way to stay employed. </p> <p></p> <p>Following these tips will make it easier for you to search for a job while you already have one, and you wont have to worry about burning any bridges. Its a small world, and you never want to alienate a former employer. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p></p>"Career,Tips for Searching for a Job When You are Unemployed,"<h1><b>Tips for Searching for a Job When You are Unemployed</b></h1> <p><b></b></p> <p>If you are unemployed and searching for a job, take heart. Youre not alone! The nice thing about being unemployed is you have more time to devote to your search for a new job and more time to make yourself into the candidate hiring managers want. Yes, you can use this time away from work to your advantage. More on that down below.</p> <p></p> <h3><b>Create a routine</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>When youre unemployed, its important to create a routine that will give you structure for your day. This will help you stay positive and avoid falling into bad habits that can hinder your job search. <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-obrien/unemployed_b_1653869.html"">View your search as your current ""job.""</a> Set specific hours and try to maintain the hours you would work as if you had a job. If youre used to working from 9 to 5, then these are the hours during which you should stay active. </p> <p><b></b></p> <h3><b>Take positive actions</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>Being unemployed is a downer, but you have to stay positive and maintain the right attitude. You can accomplish this through taking positive actions. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/03/20/10-things-to-do-while-youre-unemployed/"">Start volunteering</a> in your local community. Now that you have some extra time on your hands, you can give back to others and find fulfillment that will help you stay positive.<br></p> <p></p> <p>On the plus side, volunteering will help you broaden your current network, meet more people and increase your chances of landing a job through a referral. Dont forget to include your volunteer experience on your resume, since this can make you a more attractive candidate. Volunteer work can also be used to explain an employment gap during future job interviewers. ""I didn't work during that period, but I did learn an important lesson about...""</p> <p></p> <h3><b>Avoid desperation</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>Nothing turns a hiring manager or interviewer off more than an air of desperation. We all know how tough the job market can be, but it is important to maintain an attitude that doesn't come across this way. Staying active will keep you confident. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Get creative in your search</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>You may need to get a little creative and be flexible in your search for a job. Look for part-time work to keep yourself busy and keep cash flowing in. It can give you a chance to meet new people, and youll be getting paid while you look for work in the career of your choice. </p> <p></p> <p>The most important thing to remember when you are searching for a job while you are unemployed is to keep looking. Dont give up. Find ways to make yourself attractive as a candidate by staying positive, having a great attitude and adding to your skills. If you keep it up, you will find the right job.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"Job Search Tips,Use Your Network to Find Your Next Job,"<h1>Use Your Network to Find Your Next Job</h1><p>Personal connections are the most powerful engine for finding work. Sending in your resume after reading a posted job opening sometimes means that it lands in a (digital) pile with hundreds of others to be scanned by an automated reader. Now that we have entered the age of digital human resources, its even more essential that you think in terms of first working through a network when youre ready to find your next job.</p><h3>Network with people you know and dont know</h3><p>You might feel discouraged when you hear advice about networking because you dont see any useful job-related connections in your personal circle of friends and relatives. Think bigger. Networking is an action, and it refers to a process of establishing contact with a widening circle of new people. Social media has made it much easier to stay connected with these people, and you dont actually have to be a social butterfly in order to network every day.</p><h3><b>Be systematic</b></h3><p>Forbes senior editor Deborah L. Jacobs <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2013/03/22/the-six-best-ways-to-find-your-next-job/"">suggests</a> making a list of everyone you know, then identifying the 25 most influential people on that list and figuring out how to strengthen or renew your connections with them. She says that it's helpful to set a goal of contacting three people per week that you have not been in touch with for over a year. Reaching back in time like this is one way to enlarge your current circle of acquaintances. Jacobs also reminds eager job hunters to make sure you have a fresh resume on hand as well as an ""elevator pitch"" that's polished and ready to deliver. (An ""elevator pitch"" means a one-minute description of your goals and unique skills.)</p><h3>Use social media wisely</h3><p>LinkedIn is currently the primary social media platform for job search connections. Update your resume and profile on LinkedIn, and then joining and participate in groups that are relevant to your field. Search for the most interesting people and reach out to them. Even if you don't know them personally, you have interests in common, and they are participating in LinkedIn because they want to build their networks, too.</p><p>With your other profiles, such as Facebook and Twitter, make sure theres nothing unprofessional on your profiles and delete anything you'd never want your boss to see.</p><h3>Most jobs are not published</h3><p>Matt Youngquist, the president of Career Horizons, pointed out in an <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133474431/a-successful-job-search-its-all-about-networking"">NPR interview</a> that even though you should use job search sites (such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>,) its important to keep in mind that most jobs are not actually posted. He told NPR, ""At least 70 percent, if not 80 percent, of jobs are not published,"" and ""...the vast majority of hiring is friends and acquaintances hiring other trusted friends and acquaintances.""</p><p>This is actually a good thing because when you think of all the steps it takes to find a job, its much less intimidating to imagine a series of conversations with friends. As you build your network and talk with more and more people, youll be increasing your odds as well as your range of options.</p>"Job Search Tips,How to Search for Part-Time Jobs,"<h1>How to Search for Part-Time Jobs</h1><p>People search for part-time jobs for different reasons. Some are looking for extra income beyond their current full-time jobs. Others want the flexibility and free time that part-time jobs offer, and they might not need as much money to keep their lifestyle afloat. Regardless of your situation, searching for part-time work is a little different than searching for full-time work. Here are some points to consider when looking for part-time jobs.</p><p></p><h3><b>Focus on your interests</b></h3>Part-time jobs often dont pay as well as full-time work, so it is important to search for jobs that match your interests. Instead of focusing on money, strive to find jobs that take you where you want to be. Try looking for jobs that will teach you new skills or open doors into industries into which you want to move. Getting your foot in the door is often the hardest part.<br><p></p><p></p><h3><b>Use an RSS feed</b></h3>Job searching can take up a huge chunk of your time. Increase efficiency by setting up an RSS feed that you can check on a regular basis. RSS services, such<a href=""http://cloud.feedly.com/#welcome"">Feedly.com</a>, make it easy to quickly scan through lots of jobs, letting you expand on any that look interesting. If that's too technical for you, go to <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> and sign up for email job alerts.<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3><b>Leverage your network</b></h3>In many cases, your best chances of getting a job are through the back door. Let your friends and family know you are looking for a part-time job, and ask them to keep their eyes and ears open. Getting a job by way of a recommendation is much easier than going through the standard application process. As <a href=""http://ucs.yalecollege.yale.edu/content/networking"">Yale College Undergraduate Career Services</a> points out, ""Through networking you can uncover job opportunities that might not yet or never -- be posted on job-sites, or create an opportunity that did not previously exist.""<br><p></p><p></p><h3><b>Consider contract positions</b></h3>Since part-time jobs rarely come with any benefits, think about including contract positions in your job search. Many companies like hiring contract workers because they can end the relationship quickly and painlessly, but they can also give you a chance to prove yourself. While this type of job is usually more short-term, it can often lead to further work or even a freelance career.<p></p><p></p><h3>Important Considerations for Job Searchers<br></h3><p></p><ol><li><b>Part-time jobs are on the rise: </b>Businesses are hiring part-time workers more than ever. Why? Hiring part-time is a way to get around paying for employee health insurance, and health insurance now ultimately falls under the federal government's domain. If you are happy to work less than 30 hours a week, it will be easier than ever to find part-time jobs. According to<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324492604579087044033601178.html"">the Wall Street Journal</a>, ""ObamaCare imposes new mandates and penalties on companies with more than 50 full-time employees and even those working 30 hours a week are considered full-time.""<br></li><li><b>Part-time can lead to full-time</b>: Many companies think they only need an employee part-time, but that can change. When looking for a part-time job, keep in mind that you might eventually end up working full-time. All it takes is one or two other employees leaving for you to increase your hours quickly.<br></li></ol><p></p>A great place to look for part-time jobs is on a job search engine such as<a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>."Job Search Tips,Why You Should Use Job Finder Alerts,"<h1><b>Why You Should Use Job Finder Alerts</b></h1> <p></p> <p>In todays competitive job market, job seekers need to cover all bases. This often means looking at job boards every day for hours to scour new job postings and apply for them as they become available. There is a way we think you should know about that lets you stay on top of job postings while saving time. Job finder alerts simplify the entire job search process, and they can be used to ensure that dont miss out on new listings.</p> <p></p> <p>There are several reasons why job finder alerts benefit for job seekers.Lets take a look at why you need to be incorporating this tool into your job search.</p><h3><b>Job alert options</b></h3><p></p><p>Most job sites such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> give job seekers an option to set up email job alerts based on keywords. For example, if you want to find a job as an accountant, you can set up your alert to find new jobs with this keyword in a specific geographic region. We advise setting up more than one alert if you think that hiring managers will post a job you are interested in under different titles.</p><p></p><p>Another way to monitor new job postings, particularly if a site doesnt offer alerts, is to use<a href=""http://www.google.com/alerts"">Google Alerts</a>. This is a free tool that allows you to input your desired keywords. Youll get an email whenever new pages are posted that contain your set keywords.</p><p>Important: <a href=""http://help.business.uconn.edu/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=178"">set your email filters</a> once you have your alerts in place. If you use Gmail, you can label and prioritize your alerts so that they'll be the first things you see. No matter what email client you use, creating filters or adding each service's email address to your address book will help ensure that your job alerts don't end up in your spam folder.</p> <p></p> <h3><b>Stand out from the crowd</b></h3> <p></p> <p>Two things that help job seekers compete are 1.) how quickly they respond to a job posting and 2.) whether or not their skill set is a good match for the position. By targeting the jobs you are qualified to do with a job finder alert, youre going to get a list that is tailored to your skill set, and you will receive it in real time. Youll be among the first to know about a new job and can apply before other candidates do. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Make your job search more efficient</b></h3> <p></p> <p>Using a job finder alert is like having a virtual recruiter help you find a new job. As the alerts come in, you can respond to the job postings in which you are interested. This is a much more efficient way to search, rather than wading through numerous job listings just to find one that might be a good fit for you. </p> <p></p> <p>One more tip: Its a good idea to create a <a href=""http://www.wa.gov/esd/guides/jobsearch/strategy/strat_tips.htm"">tracking database</a> of the jobs you respond to from your alerts. This will give you the ability to easily see where youve sent your resume, and you can keep track of the responses you receive.</p> <p></p>"Interviews,How to Write a Cover Letter That Gets Noticed,"<h1>How to Write a Cover Letter that Gets Noticed</h1><p>The cover letter is one of the most important parts of a job application. It introduces you to the recruiter, explains why you're applying and shows off your professionalism. In order to get an interview, you need to do more than provide all of the required information. You need to create a cover letter that will grab a reader's attention.</p><h3>Use a conversational tone</h3><p>Cover letters are important, but that doesn't mean you have to use formal language. Recruiters are turned off by awkward sentences full of extra words. Keep your intro short, sweet and confident. ""I am excited to read that you're hiring..."" is fine and is more likely to get a response than ""Consider this cover letter to be a declaration of interest in the advertised position."" YAWN.</p><h3>Grab the recruiter's attention right away</h3><p>Job recruiters skim cover letters in order to find out the facts. Put something near the beginning of yours that will make them slow down and read your cover letter more thoroughly. One of the best ways to do this is to include a specific, strong accomplishment that is not in your resum. Facts such as, ""Last year, my company's profits went up by 40 percent because of changes I implemented"" will get recruiters' attention and compel them to actually read your letter.</p><h3>Demonstrate interest in the company</h3><p>Don't write a generic letter about how you want to work in the industry. Instead, demonstrate that you want to work for this particular company. Talk about products, services or features you admire that this particular company provides. If you aren't familiar with the company, research it before writing your cover letter so that you can express genuine enthusiasm.</p><h3>Talk about how you can benefit the company</h3><p>Many people make the mistake of talking solely about why they want to work there. Make your cover letter stand out by listing specific benefits you will provide to the boss if you are hired.</p><div>Avoid generalities such as ""I will work hard."" Nobody admits on a job application that they like to slack off, so these kinds of statements are meaningless. Instead, state specifics such as, ""I can free up your time to deal with clients by providing expert customer service over the phone and keeping your appointment book and paperwork organized."" These types of statements demonstrate that you are a one-of-a-kind individual who can provide unique services to the company. The recruiter will take notice.</div><h3>Check your spelling</h3><p>So many people miss the obvious step of proofreading their work that correct spelling will automatically make your cover letter stand out. You should proofread manually as well as run a spelling and grammar check on your word processing software to ensure you catch every mistake. Submitting a mistake-free cover letter not only demonstrates your professionalism, but also shows that you take time to check details two qualities for which recruiters are hungry. If you know an editor or copy editor, ask them for a proofread.</p><h3>Keep it short</h3><p>The longer your letter is, the less interesting it is to a recruiter.

If youre using your resume objective to describe your wish list, then youre missing your first chance to sell yourself. Dont make this classic mistake.</p><h3>Propose a new purpose</h3><h3><p>According to<a href=""http://rockportinstitute.com/resumes/"">Rockport Institute author Nicholas Lore</a>, ""The resume is a tool with one specific purpose: to win an interview."" You should focus on that one thing. Your resume sells you to your prospective employer with that one goal in mind. The resume gets you an interviewor not. Thats it. Thats the best and only thing your resume can accomplish.<br></p></h3><h3>The classic objective</h3><p>Old-fashioned resumes used the objective section to describe what the job seeker wanted from their new position. The theory was that by describing the work they desired, they revealed whatkind of employee they were; however, nowadays it reveals that theyre more interested in themselves than their prospective employers.According to <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2013/01/15/resumes-101-swap-a-stale-objective-for-a-fresh-branding-statement"">Arnie Fertig of U.S. News</a>, ""These days, any resume reader assumes that their job is your objective."" Talking about anything else you might want just wastes their time.</p><p>To insert a contemporary twist on a classic objective, you might want to try something like this:</p><p>""Highly motivated, future IT graduate seeks temporary internship providing hands-on training in troubleshooting hardware and software technologies.""</p><h3>Branding yourself</h3><p>Here's another thought.<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeromeyoung/2011/06/27/how-to-write-a-resume-summary-section-that-gets-interviews/"">Forbes contributor Jerome Young</a> advises job seekers to skip the objective statement. ""Instead,"" Young says, ""you should use the opening section of your resume to summarize what makes you a good fit for an open position.""You do this by branding yourself as a viable candidate for the position you want. Fertig recommends focusing on your attributes, your value and your uniqueness. Young says CEASE is the way to go: characteristics, experience, achievements, skills and expertise.</p><p>Always start with the targeted position in mind. A good job advertisement will tell you what a prospective employer is looking for in their next hire. The company website will tell you what the advertisement doesnt. When you visit the website, youre looking for keywords, just like youd enter into a search engine. You want to choose the keywords that best describe what you have to offer. You want to state your value clearly and succinctly using some of the keywords that appear on the company's website. This brands you as the right person for this specific position.</p><p>To brand yourself as the solution to a prospective employer's problem, you should try something like this:</p><p>""Results-driven IT professional with over 30 years experience applying information technologies in a healthcare setting seeks to utilize IS expertise to support the operation and strategic objectives of a growing and progressive healthcare organization.""</p><h3>Write Persuasively</h3><p>Youre creating an advertisement, so write persuasively. Active words are best; present tense is essential. In todays ""buyers market,"" job seekers are an overabundant commodity. In order to make the cut for that interview, you need to prove that youre more than a commodity. You must show that you are a uniquely appropriate fit for the work they need done.</p><p>Dont just write a resume objective. Prove your value by writing a clear message that shows you have their needs in mind. You know you can deliver. If you can prove that, then your resume can land you an interview. From there, its all up to you.</p>"Resumes,Where to Find Free Resumes,"<h1><b>Where to Find Free Resumes, for Print and Digital</b></h1> <p>When starting the hunt for a new job, nothing is as important as having a great resume.

Interviews are an opportunity for you to get to know your potential employers and for them get to know you. Its important, during the interview, that you <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-willyerd/interview-nerves_b_3178193.html"">stay calm</a> and confident so you can accurately convey your work experience and reveal your personality. Here are a few tips on how to interview with confidence.</p> <p></p> <h3>Monitor your speech</h3><div>Cara Hale Alter has spent nearly 20 years researching why many intelligent, competent people are great at projecting confidence while others aren't. Her findings fall into different categories, such as posture, gestures and eye contact, but she has found one of the biggest factors in exuding confidence is<a href=""http://www.trainingmag.com/content/projecting-confidence-and-competence"">vocal skills</a>. This includes everything from making sure to talk at a calm, slow pace of 170 words per minute, as well as including thoughtful and deliberate pauses in your speech. Test yourself by reading or speaking out loud and timing yourself to make sure you aren't speaking too quickly or too slowly.</div> <h3>Rehearse</h3><div>Nothing will make you feel more prepared and enable you to keep your cool under pressure like <a href=""http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/06/28/right-way-to-rehearse-for-job-interview/"">rehearsing for an interview </a>beforehand. Find as many sample interview questions as you can (we have many here on this site) and write down your answers. Practice your answers in the mirror until you can get to the point where you don't need to read them off the paper anymore. You don't want to sound like a robot, but you do want to sound calm, cool and collected. Go in knowing how to answer so that the words roll easily off your tongue.</div><h3>Do your research</h3> <p>Nothing takes a toll on your confidence like being under-prepared. Be sure to do <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/jobs/before-the-job-interview-do-your-homework.html"">a lot of research</a> on the company and the duties of the position in which youre interested before you go. Your prospective employer will want you to have a genuine interest in the company, and showing you have taken the time to learn about them will demonstrate that interest.</p> <h3>Know what you have to offer</h3> <p>Go into the interview knowing that you are the right person for the job because of what you can offer the company. This will not only boost your confidence during the interview but also help your interviewers realize why you stand out from other candidates. Make sure you understand exactly what they are seeking from an employee and what specific skills or ideas you can bring to the table.</p> <p></p> <h3>Dress for Success</h3><p>Your appearance can play a big role in interviewing with confidence. Make sure you are well-rested and <a href=""http://work.chron.com/color-shirts-reveal-confidence-during-interview-18170.html"">well-dressed</a> before the big day. Youll want to feel relaxed and comfortable but also <a href=""http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/intelligent-design-how-clothing-affects-the-mind/"">sharp and professional</a> in order to exude the most confidence. Wearing a clean, crisp outfit or suit can not only make you <i>look</i>well-prepared; it can also make you <i>feel</i> more confident.</p>"Resumes,I Need a Job: How Do I Get an Interview?,"<h1><b>I Need a Job: How Do I Get an Interview?</b></h1> <p align=""center""><b></b></p> <p>If you are applying for numerous jobs, but nothing is happening, youre probably asking yourself, ""How do I get an interview?"" This is a common question among job seekers. There are a few ways you can structure your job search to increase the likelihood that you will land interviews.</p> <p></p> <h3><b>Look for the right job</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>The main reason why job seekers dont get interviews is that the person reading through their resumes doesn't think the applicant is qualified to do the job. Unless you are in a position to make a horizontal move to a different career, stick with jobs that are in your current skill set. If you want to do something else and become a more attractive candidate, you need to invest in continuing education to get the skills that the interviewer wants to see. Be realistic and take the time to match yourself up with the right job. </p> <p><b></b></p> <h3><b>Structure your resume for quick reading</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>Creating a resume that <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/susannahbreslin/2011/04/11/how-to-get-a-job-interview/"">stands out</a> and is easy to read will increase your chances of getting an interview. Structure it with your skill sets and important information in bullet points and small paragraphs. A busy hiring manager doesnt have time to read every word of a resume. Theyre going to be scanning it, so you want to make sure you stand out.</p> <p></p> <h3><b>Use the right keywords in your resume</b></h3> <p><b></b></p> <p>Large companies that receive loads of applications are now using scanning software to help them narrow down the field. This means that the software is looking for specific keywords inside the resume file. If it doesnt find the keywords that it wants, those resumes are rejected. Take the time to study the relevant keywords for the industry and company youre applying for, and make sure you include them in your resume in a natural way. </p> <p><b></b></p> <h3>Write a killer cover letter</h3><p>Always take advantage of the opportunity to include a great cover letter with your resume, even if you are submitting your resume online. This is quite often the tipping point when it comes to landing an interview. Personalize each cover letter you submit and tailor it to the job you're applying for. Keep it less than 400 words. Use this space to showcase unique talents that you will bring to the position. Address the letter to the person who will be doing the hiring for that position. If needs be, call the company and get that person's name. Proofread your cover letter thoroughly. It helps to print it out and actually read it aloud to ensure you're not making any mistakes. </p><h3>Keep your social profiles professional</h3><p>Even if you aren't using social media to find a job, it isvital to make sure your <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/04/16/how-social-media-can-help-or-hurt-your-job-search/"">profiles are professional</a>. Go through your current profiles and check for grammar mistakes and errors. You want everything to read smoothly and showcase your abilities. Next, you're going to want to go through past posts you and others have made on your profiles. If it is not something you would want a boss to see, remove it. Employers rely on social profiles to give them more information on candidates. You want to make sure that your profile helps you instead of hurting your chances. </p> <p>Now that youve answered the question, ""How do I get an interview?"" it is time to put this new knowledge to work. Get out there and <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">start applying for jobs</a>.</p>"Interviews,Good Answers to Common Job Interview Questions,"<h1>Good Answers to Common Job Interview Questions</h1><p>When you get that phone call asking you to come in for a job interview, it feels great. But if youre like most people, your thoughts soon turn to how you will answer the interview questions you know you will soon be asked. The following are three of the most common job interview questions and some advice on the best approach to answering them.</p><h3>""Tell me about yourself.""</h3><p>The <a href=""http://www.dllr.state.md.us/county/brochures/dirtydozen.shtml"">Career Center</a> at Marylands Department of Labor reminds job seekers that the proper response to this question is to talk about your working self, not your family self. Practice a brief monologue ahead of time with a stopwatch and work at getting your answer down to under 90 seconds. The beginning of your mini speech should mention your job history, the middle should highlight some specific work-related accomplishment and the last part should explain your future professional goals (and how the job youre applying for fits into your plan to achieve those goals.) Employers ask this question partly to learn more about you and partly to gauge whether you display good judgment in what you choose to talk about.</p><h3>""What is your greatest weakness?""</h3><p>Its a good idea to come to the interview with an appropriate personal weakness carefully thought out and prepared for display. You cant get away with pretending to be perfect, but you can plan ahead and mention a failing that wont alarm the employer. Think about what the job involves, then choose a weakness that is not relevant to the normal job activities. For example, if the job involves continuous interaction with the public, you could say that you enjoy socializing so much that sometimes you dont do as much quiet reading and solitary reflection as you should. If the job requires a lot of personal responsibility, you can say that you sometimes have a hard time delegating tasks to others. Always be honest. An interviewer is partly watching to see if you have the social skills to give appropriate answers. Whatever weakness you mention, you should always add that you are making specific efforts to correct it.</p><h3>""Why do you want this job?""</h3><p>In the <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-29/jobs/sns-201301161600--tms--careersntp--h-a20130123-20130123_1_job-interviewer-10-reasons"">Chicago Tribune</a>, Joyce Lain Kennedy recommends using this question as an opportunity to re-state your credentials and convey enthusiasm and commitment. This is where you can show that youve done your homework as you explain why your particular skills are such a good fit for this particular business. Study the companys website and any other materials you can find so that you have a couple of very specific points to make about why the particular direction or style of this business impresses you. Above all, convey a sense of enthusiasm about how your goals and the goals of the company will work well together.</p><p>By preparing carefully ahead of time and practicing your answers to common job interview questions, you will radiate a sense of confidence when you walk into the interview room, and that alone is a highly attractive quality to employers.</p>"Career,The Benefits of Government Jobs,"<h1>The Benefits of Government Jobs</h1><p>As the private economy meanders in the wake of economic turbulence and businesses reduce benefits, some job seekers are taking a second look at government jobs. As<a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-51344044/government-jobs-how-to-get-them/"">CBS News Moneywatch</a>so aptly put it, ""a government job can offer long-term rewards or a great place to ride out the downturn.""</p><h3>Diverse opportunities</h3><p>You might think of the government as one enormous monolith, with thousands of employees working away in cubicles. Actually, government employment is divided up among so many departments and agencies that there's a chance you could find work in a field interests you. Love nature and being outside? You can work for the National Parks Service and spend your days (and nights) out in the forest or the desert. Want to do research to end childhood cancer? Apply for a job at the National Institutes of Health. Browse through <a href=""http://bestplacestowork.org/BPTW/index.php"">The Best Places to Work</a>, a government site that publishes rankings and reviews on its own employee satisfaction levels.</p><h3>Fair employment practices</h3><p>Government work offers a sanctuary from the subjective and secretive pay practices of the business world. Each government position has a title and a pay grade, and you can look these up on a <a href=""http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2012/general-schedule/2012-gs-annual-rates-by-grade-and-step/"">public chart</a>. Public employers at the state, county and city levels have similar open pay practices. Also, the public hiring process is bound by a number of equal opportunity employment laws, so if you belong to an under-represented minority group, you will not encounter discrimination. </p><h3>Job security and financial stability</h3><p>In addition to the regulations governing fair hiring practices, government jobs have a complex set of procedures in place to protect workers from arbitrary dismissal. Paul Light, a professor of public service at New York University, was quoted by <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2007/sep/05/mcain-federal/"">Politifact </a>as saying, ""Very few federal employees...are ever fired on the basis of poor performance."" Many politicians have pointed this fact out, but as John Palguta of the Partnership for Public Service explains, ""It's not supposed to be easy to fire federal workers for the wrong reasons.""</p><p>While federal salaries are roughly equivalent or in excess of the private sector on many levels, according to <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2012/11/14/5-tips-for-getting-a-government-job/"">Forbes</a>, the health care benefits and pension plans for government jobs are generally better than what is possible in the private sector except at the highest levels. The American Enterprise Institute did a <a href=""http://www.aei-ideas.org/2011/09/how-generous-are-federal-employee-pensions/"">comparative analysis</a>thatshowed that a public sector worker ends up with pension benefits that pay more than twice the annual rate of those earned by a similar worker in the private sector.</p>"Career,5 Work from Home Careers,"<p></p><h1>5 Work from Home Careers</h1><p></p><p>If you want to live the dream and make money without leaving your home, you need to choose the right career. Many jobs can be done from home. Of course, they still require you to work hard and have the discipline to meet your deadlines, but as long as you are able to make your work your priority, you can reap the benefits of setting your own schedule and working in your pajamas if you so desire. These are five of the most popular work-from-home careers. <br></p> <h3>Teacher/tutor <br></h3> <p>According to <a href=""http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2012/07/16/seven-legitimate-work-at-home-jobs-for-20-somethings/"">Fox Business</a>, you can teach students without even leaving your house. Online teaching positions allow you to teach classes using the Internet, with the average hourly rate running $10 to $14. In this job, you can expect to post video lectures and assign homework through sophisticated websites that feature calendars, message boards and other functions. Though colleges are often in need of online instructors, elementary schools, middle schools and high schools also offer online classes. You typically need a college degree for this type of job, but if you do not have one, you may still qualify to become an online tutor. <br></p> <h3>Writer <br></h3> <p>If you can write well, you can make money working from home. As long as you have a computer and an Internet connection, you can write and edit for clients who need content. You can choose to specialize in a topic  such as legal or medical content  or you can write blogs, articles and press releases for clients. One advantage of this career is that you do not have to adhere to a set schedule, although you will have many deadlines. You can achieve success in this career without a college degree as long as you can prove you are a good writer who has something to offer. According to <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/pictures/lmj45gmmh/no-8-writers-and-authors/"">Forbes</a>, the median salary is about $55,000. <br></p> <h3>Web designer <br></h3> <p>If you're creative and want to work from home, web design is another career to consider. It requires you to combine a passion for art with knowledge of design software, since you will need to create designs that look good on computer screens, smartphones and tablets. The <a href=""http://work.chron.com/self-employed-designer-salary-5870.html"">Houston Chronicle</a> reports that the typical self-employed web designer can earn around $50 per hour.  <br></p> <h3>Web developer <br></h3> <p>If you're interested in a job that makes use of logic and software, you might enjoy the position of web developer. This job requires you to know programming languages so that you can create websites from the ground up. According to <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/web-developer/salary"">US News & World Report</a>, the median salary for web developers is just under $78,000. <br></p> <h3>Virtual assistant <br></h3> <p>If you like the idea of having a variety of tasks to complete each day, as well as helping others, you should look into becoming a virtual assistant. This is similar to a personal assistant or secretary position in that you might do everything from scheduling appointments and answering phone calls to entering data and updating social media sites for your clients. Of course, like all work from home careers, you do not have to leave your house to complete your work. According to <a href=""http://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/business/T012-S001-10-great-work-at-home-jobs/index.html"">Kiplinger</a>, you can earn $28 to $45 per hour in this position.</p>"Career,Everything You Need to Know about Working in Construction,"<h1>Everything You Need to Know about Working in Construction</h1><p>Job openings for construction workers are increasing by<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/construction-laborers-and-helpers.htm#tab-1"">25 percent</a>, according to the federal government, and the current pay rate averages a median $13.66 an hour. This makes working in construction a good prospect for those who love working with tools or building things. If you want to work in construction, but aren't sure what requirements you have to meet or what titles you must hold, keep reading.</p><h3>Job information</h3><p>Aconstruction worker is any skilled worker or unskilled tradesmen who falls under the following categories:</p><p></p><ul><li>Carpenter</li><li>Electrician</li><li>Mason</li><li>Ironworker</li><li>Heavy construction machinery operator</li><li>Sheet metal worker</li><li>Plasterer</li><li>Plumber</li><li>Welder</li><li>Steel fixer</li></ul><p></p><p>Construction workers construct building materials and piping as well as buildings and other structures. They work indoors and outdoors and must wear protective gear to keep them safe from hazards.</p><p>Most construction workers use heavy machinery or electric tools that require training to use. This training can be given on the job. However, with large construction companies, training received in an educational setting is often required. Depending on what job a construction worker seeks, permits or licenses may also be required.</p><h2>Qualifications and Requirements</h2><p>In order to work in construction, you may be required to meet certain educational and training requirements. These requirements are set by both companies and the government and vary by state. In addition to these requirements, construction workers must also produce proof that they can work in the U.S. Some companies have hired undocumented immigrants in the past, but this practice currently is illegal. Below are some of the requirements you might need in order to work in construction.</p><h3>Educational requirements</h3><p>You don't have to meet any specific educational requirements to become a construction worker. However, if you wish to work for a large company, you may be required to show a trade certificate.</p><p>Here is an incomplete list of jobs requiring certification (for additional information or specific requirements see the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag23.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> website):</p><p></p><ul><li>Rough Terrain Forklift Operator</li><li>Scaffold User and Builder</li><li>Welder</li><li>Signal Person Qualification</li><li>Construction Site Manager</li><li>Carpenter</li><li>Steel Worker</li><li>Iron Worker</li><li>Electrician</li><li>Brick Mason</li></ul><div>Educational experience can lead to advancement opportunities, more complex duties and higher pay.</div><p></p><h3>Physical requirements</h3><div>Construction workers are expected to lift and work with heavy materials. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, those who work with cement must carry cinder blocks that weigh<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/construction-laborers-and-helpers.htm#tab-4""> 40 pounds</a> or more. This means physical strength is important.Stamina is also important. Construction workers often work in direct heat and cold for hours on end. You must have the stamina to push, pull and lift heavy items for many hours in uncomfortable temperatures.</div><h3>Training and licensing</h3><p>If you're planning to work with gas lines, electricity or water, you may need a license for those jobs as well. License requirements differ from state to state. If you're planning to work with or around those previously listed items, contact your state licensing agency for information. In addition, you will be required to obtain a federal Hazmat license if you're working with hazardous materials.<br></p><p>Some companies shortcut these requirements and ask employees to work without licenses. The United States Department of Occupational Health and Safety recommends using their <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/elaws/youth.html#.UlMr4VWzKpg"">Labor Law electronic tools </a>to find out if what you're being asked to do on the job is prohibited.</p><h3>Looking for a Construction Job</h3><p>Finding a job in construction is not difficultif you're highly skilled. The BLS states that construction laborers with the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/construction-laborers-and-helpers.htm#tab-6"">most skills</a>have the best job opportunities. If you're not highly skilled, attaining additional training, experience and education is something you should consider.</p><p>To search for a construction job, some people go directly to building sites and speak to the site manager. Others go online to search job search engines such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>. Whichever way you decide to search, be prepared with a resume and cover letter. Good luck.</p>"Career,Who Should Use an Employment Agency?,"<h1>Who Should Use an Employment Agency?</h1><p>Employment agencies help companies looking to fill vacancies as well as job-seekers trying to find positions. In addition to matching businesses with both short and long-term employees, they also provide other services for workers. From resume assistance to career guidance, some people can benefit from the services an employment agency has to offer. Likewise, companies filling positions benefit from their services in many ways as well. From slashing recruiting costs to the ability to hire workers only when they are needed, an increasing number of businesses are utilizing the services of employment agencies.<br></p><h3>Have in-demand skills?</h3><p>Job-seekers with skills in high demand often have the most to gain from using the services of an employment agency. Accounting, nursing, engineering, and computer programming are some of the most sought-after fields. While professionals in these areas usually dont have a very hard time finding work on their own, sometimes it can be advantageous to go through an agency. Jobs offered by agencies are often temporary and can be a good way for someone to get a feel for which company they like best. It is best to find employment agencies that focus on your specific industrylaw, engineering or healthcare, for example.</p><h3>Receive Expert Assistance</h3><p>For some workers, employment agencies offer the chance to obtain valuable services at no cost. Agency staff know exactly which skills are in highest demand and can steer uncertain workers in the right direction. They can also coach prospective employees on interviewing strategies and provide free training in areas like computer skills. Additionally, for those who lack the confidence to search for and interview for jobs on their own, working with an employment agency is an excellent way to gain experience and move in the right direction.<br></p><h3>Get your foot in the door </h3><p>Many companies only hire through employment agencies because it cuts down on time spent sifting through potential candidates. If you have your heart set on working for a specific company, but find out they only hire through an agency, you know where to apply--the employment agency. If you can prove yourself and get hired on directly, the long-term prospects are worth it. Remember, a surprisingly large number of new employees don't last very long. According to the<a href=""http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/the-rise-of-the-permanent-temp-economy/?_r=0"">New York Times</a>, ""Over the last three years, the temp industry added more jobs in the United States than any other."" While companies may lean on employment agencies for most of their hires, nearly all businesses recruit some workers directly as well.<br></p><h3>Obtain hands-on experience</h3><p>Need some hands-on experience? One of the best things about working through an employment agency is the ability to try out all kinds of different jobs. Getting sent out to different companies for short-term assignments can be a great way to learn new skills and gain valuable experience. In addition, if a job just isnt right for you, it is fairly easy to quickly leave it for something that is a better fit. While you probably wouldnt want to include a two week job on your resume, you can definitely add any new skills learned. Additionally, taking temporary jobs eliminates empty spaces in your resume<br></p><h3>A chance to network</h3><p>Since the majority of job searching is done at home on the computer, working at an employment agency can give people a much-needed chance to network. The opportunity to work side by side with people in areas that interest you can be well worth it. As a recent <a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/jobs/chi-temp-job-career-20130603,0,2369658.story"">Chicago Tribune article</a> explains, ""your new contacts can provide job leads, connect you with other people in the industry or serve as future job references.""<br></p><h3>Who should not use employment agencies</h3><p>Job seekers who are looking for permanent positions that earn enough to support a family should be hesitant when using employment agencies as a long-term solution. Jobs at an employment agency nearly always pay less than direct company hires. For this reason, while you might want to consider taking temp jobs in the short term, make sure you also make time to search for jobs outside of the agency as well.</p><p>If you're on the market for a new job, consider how an employment agency can benefit you on your job search.</p>"Career,The Advantages of Working for a Small Business,"<p></p><h1>The Advantages of Working for a Small Business</h1><p></p><p>If you are looking for a job, you might want to consider working for a small business. After all, <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/08/20/small-business-hiring/2662407/"">USA Today</a>reports there is job growth at small companies, with available jobs totaling 82,000. If you are not sure whether you should work at a small business, here are four advantages of doing so. <br></p> <h3>You can get to know your boss </h3> <p>In a large corporation, you might never meet or get to know the owner of the business. When you work for a smaller company, though, it is likely you will see the owner on a regular basis and get to know him or her. According to <a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226176"">Entrepreneur</a>, more than half of the people who participated in a 2012 poll think of small business owners as honest and ethical. Getting to know the person is power can benefit you even after you move on to another job. <br></p> <h3>You'll take on many roles at a small business </h3> <p>When you work for a smaller company, your job title doesn't limit you like it may at a major corporation. That means that if youre a bookkeeper who also happens to be good at designing logos, you could do some side projects involving graphic design when the business needs your expertise. The main advantage here is that you can build your resume, which may help you land a job in graphic design if you decide to change careers. Also, depending on the number of roles and responsibilities you are given, you might end up learning about every aspect of a business so you can eventually start your own company with confidence. <br></p> <h3>You're a big fish in a little pond </h3> <p>You probably hear this phrase often because it's true. According to the <a href=""http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/sme.htm"">University of Kent</a>, when there are not very many employees and you are doing a good job, you will stand out. This can lead to more frequent promotions, raises or awards at work. If you enjoy being recognized for your hard work, a small business is probably a better place for you than a large company. <br></p> <h3>You can expect to see the results of your hard work </h3> <p>When you work for a corporation, you play a very small role in most projects, so it is hard to see the impact you are making. With a small business, you might take on a project on your own or with only a few other people. Once it is completed, you are able to see the fruits of your labor quite clearly. <br></p> <p>This could be why the <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2012/10/16/are-you-happy-at-work/"">Wall Street Journal</a> reported on a poll that working for a small business with fewer than 100 employees makes you 25 percent more likely to be happy at work. This statistic alone should persuade you to look for a job at a small business start browsing today on job boards such as<a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/job-search/"">Simply Hired</a>.</p>"Career,How to Break into a Career in IT,"<h1>How to Break into a Career in IT</h1><p>We live in an age instant communication, and the various technologies used to distribute information are evolving rapidly. If you find yourself interested in technology beyond the basic consumer level of use, you should consider a career in IT (information technology). This field is constantly developing, offering both challenging work and good pay, and as a result it has become quite popular. There are a variety of pathways to becoming an IT professional. The common theme among them: adaptability and the ability to keep up with cutting edge technology.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Most IT jobs require a bachelors degree in a relevant branch of technology. Its worth spending time simply reading through college catalogs and websites to get acquainted with all the various IT-related fields of study that exist. Some of these majors might be unfamiliar to you because theyre being revised and updated continually. At <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/dept/uga/academic/programs/engineering.html"">Stanford</a>, for example, its possible to major in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence, biocomputation, programming methodology or programming abstractions. Majors in electrical engineering include: electronics, computer systems, information theory, bioelectrical engineering and green electrical engineering.</p><h3>IT Support Positions</h3><p>These positions are more entry level and their educational requirements are modest. The Bureau of Labor Statistics page for<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-support-specialists.htm"">Computer Support Specialists</a> notes that a college degree is not required for this type of position. The field is expected to grow by 18 percent in the coming decade. This job category includes various types of technical support roles within a wide range of industries, and in most cases, on-the-job training is offered for each companys specialized equipment.</p><h3>Independent Work<br></h3><p>It's possible to create a unique pathway into the IT world by putting your skills to work from home on your own time. There are two different approaches to independent work: Hire yourself out as a freelancer or create and sell your own product.</p><p>Freelance work can be as simple as registering and picking up assignments from a platform such as<a href=""https://www.odesk.com/"">Odesk</a>,<a href=""null"">Elance</a>or even your local <a href=""http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites"">Craigslist.</a> (Check the ""gigs"" section.) If you want to take your freelance work to the next level, create an online business presence with a slick website and a social media marketing campaign.</p><p>If you prefer the potential for much higher income and you don't mind investing long hours, developing and marketing your own app is another option. Over 235,000 developers have successfully sold their apps through Apple, and <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/tristanlouis/2013/08/10/how-much-do-average-apps-make/"">Forbes</a> found that the average freelance developer makes about $4,000 per app that he or she markets through Apple. Some apps, of course, strike a sweet spot and bring in far more money, but it's important to know that this new type of entrepreneurship is definitely <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/business/as-boom-lures-app-creators-tough-part-is-making-a-living.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"">a bit of a gamble</a>. <br></p><h3>Internships</h3><p>With many IT jobs, the technology moves faster than any college curriculum, so internships are a crucial piece of becoming marketable in this field. By taking an internship with an IT company, you will have the opportunity to engage with professionals at a level that is not possible for many students. Internships put you on the inside of current developments in a specific technology and keep you up to date on cutting-edge innovations. Internships can be found on dedicated internship directory websites or on general job board websites like <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/k-information-technology-jobs.html"">Simply Hired</a>.</p><p>One last piece of advice: Go where the jobs are. Every organization in every city needs IT on some level, but the real action is happening in Northern California, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and the Puget Sound region in Washington State.</p>"Job Search Tips,How to Find Local Jobs,"<h1><b>How to Find Local Jobs</b></h1> <p align=""center""><b></b></p> <p>Many job seekers would prefer to find a job in their local area, close to wherever they call home. Depending on the size of your town, the new methods of finding of a job online and through social media <a href=""http://jobsearch.about.com/od/findajob/qt/localjob.htm"">may not always work</a>. However, there are plenty of ways to find local jobs that involve a mix of online searching, glad-handing and shoe leather. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Network within your community</b></h3> <p></p> <p>This is perhaps the best way to get a job in your community. If you arent already a part of your community--your town, place of worship or local school--then this is the time to start getting involved. Attend local business networking events. Take some time to volunteer. Youll meet influential people who will be able to assist you in your job search.</p> <p></p> <p>The best way to network to find a job is to subtly let it be known that youre looking for a new job. Let your attitude and your work ethic do the rest of the talking. If people see that you would be a good employee, and youre not hounding them to find you a job, chances are they will be more apt to help you find work. </p> <p></p> <h3><b>Utilize online job sites</b></h3> <p></p> <p>Some online job sites are still useful for local job seekers, particularly if you are in an industry that utilizes websites and social media. Set email job alerts with your favorite online job sites such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> to help alert you when a new job in your area is posted.This technique is going to help expand your local job search. Never assume that just because youre in a small town that employers arent using the Internet to post jobs. Check the profiles of local businesses on Facebook and Twitter. They may be posting their job openings on social media. Your state probably offers a jobs website as well.</p> <p></p> <h3><b>Traditional job postings</b></h3> <p></p> <p>Sometimes the traditional way of finding a job still works best for <a href=""http://www.kckcc.edu/services/studentServices/careerPlanningAndPlacement/generalInformation/activeVsTraditionalJobSearchMethods.aspx"">local job seekers</a>, particularly in small towns. Look through your local newspapers, pay attention to your local radio stations and check out any community sites, bulletin boards or newsletters that are available. Many employers use these means to find new employees.</p><p> Another way to find a job in your area is to go to businesses that youre interested in working for and introduce yourself. Some businesses dont do much when it comes to actively looking for new candidates, but they will post help wanted notices in the window or inside at the main desk. </p> <p></p> <p>No matter what industry youre in, finding local jobs can take time. The key is to stay positive and keep looking. If you dont have a job right now, volunteering can help you network and get out of the house. This will help you maintain a more positive attitude. Plus, you can fill this gap in your resume with good deeds, which hiring managers tend to look kindly upon.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"Career,Find Jobs that Match Your Experience Level,"<h1>Find Jobs that Match Your Experience Level</h1><p>Applying for a job that doesn't match your experience level wastes your time and the hiring manager's. But how do you know if you have the right qualifications for a job? What if the job looks like step up in responsibility? Or a step down? Should you still apply? No worries. We've got you covered. Here's how to find jobs that match your experience level.</p><h3><b>Don't settle or overreach</b></h3><p>One mistake that job seekers make, despite the availability of a healthier selection of choices, is taking a job for which they are not a good fit. Some people take jobs that land them in way over their heads. Others take positions that don't really require all they have to offer. These people in particular are considered ""overqualified"" and will generally not be as happy or productive in their work as they could be. Don't let that be you.</p><h3><b>Search diligently</b></h3><p>One way to make sure that you are taking a job that actually matches your experience level is to be diligent in your job search. Positions that are perfect for you will not pop up all the time. These roles can disappear almost as quickly as they appear. You need to grab them when they go public--or before, if possible. Doing your job search using a mobile device certainly helps in this regard. There are plenty of applications out there these days <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">that can alert you to new jobs</a> posted and allow you to search for the perfect job on the fly. A <a href=""http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/08/02/apps-that-allow-to-take-your-job-search-on-go/"">recent study</a> showed that9.3 million workers searched for jobs using their mobile devices. That was an increase of more than six million over the previous year. Make sure that you're not falling behind in your job search because you aren't using all the tools at your disposal.</p><h3><b>Know your strengths and weaknesses</b></h3><p>Another way to ensure that you are finding a role that is <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2011/10/10/magazines/moneymag/best_jobs_career_changers/index.htm"">well-suited</a> for you is to be fully aware of what your strengths and limitations truly are. If you are someone who is looking for your second or third career, you want to make sure that you don't jump into a place where you are in over your head or take a job that bores you. Understand your limitations and apply what you know about yourself.</p><h3><b>Get help</b></h3><p>If you are having a problem deciding how your skills match up with the job you want, there are people you can turn to. Agencies around the country offer a service known as job counseling. Job counselors are trained at evaluating--through testing as well as other methods--your skill level and what kind of job suits you. These people will have only done their jobs if you find a job that matches your skill level.</p><p>If you go into a job search well-prepared, you will be able to find jobs that match your experience level and you might be surprised at just how easily it went.

If you are changing careers, re-entering the workforce after a long absence or have a very long work history, you should consider using a functional resum rather than a chronological one. Functional resums give prospective employers a clearer picture of your relevant work history, your skills and your abilities. <div><div><h3>Focus on your skills</h3><p>Unlike a chronological resum, which focuses on your work experience, a <a href=""http://writing.colostate.edu/guides/documents/resume/functionalSample.pdf"">functional resum</a> focuses on your skill set. You should include a ""Skills"" section near the top of the resum. In this section, list specific skills you possess that are relevant to the type of position you're seeking. It's best to use headings and bullet points in this section. For example, you might list ""Research Skills"" as one of your skill sets, then in bullet points list online research in specific medical databases, lab research and researching articles in scientific journals.</p><h3>Include relevant work experience</h3><p>Just because your resum is functional doesn't mean you should leave out work experience. The trick is to choose the most relevant experience. Instead of describing the work in detail, make a list of jobs in reverse chronological order. Don't worry about gaps in employment. The purpose of creating a functional resum is to provide employers with the most relevant experiences. If there are gaps, they won't be as obvious as they would be on a chronological resum; your prospective employer will assume you didn't include less relevant experiences.</p></div><div>To determine which work experiences to include, ask yourself these questions in relation to the job for which you're applying:</div><div><ul><li>How relevant are the skills I used on this job?</li><li>How relevant is the title of this position?</li><li>How recent is this position?</li></ul><p>It's best to include recent experiences whenever possible, especially in industries that have seen a lot of changes. For example, if you're going for an IT job, experience from the 1970s or 1980s will not be pertinent except as part of a longer list, as technology has changed.</p></div><h3>Include education</h3><p>Employers want to see your education. Include relevant degrees at the bottom of the resum in reverse chronological order. Include continuing education courses. Taking recent courses related to your industry is more important than a degree that isn't recent or relevant, although you will want to include your degree if you're required to have one for the position.</p><h3>Keep it short</h3><p>Keep your resum to less than one page if you can. Long resums may never be seen. If your resum is too long, examine it with an eye towards keeping only the most relevant data.</p><div>Writing a functional resum is different than a chronological resume, but if you are in the midst of a career transition it can be a real asset. By putting only the most relevant information on your resum, you can often increase your chances of landing your next job.</div></div>"Resumes,Questions to Ask at the End of a Job Interview,"<h1>Questions to Ask at the End of a Job Interview</h1><p></p><p>Many job seekers research the best answers to common interview questions. While this is a great tactic, the questions a job seeker gets to ask at the end of a job interview are also important. Ask the wrong questions, or even worse, none at all, and your chances of getting a job take a nosedive.</p><p>Many job seekers fail to realize that the interview process is just as much a chance for them to get to know the company as the other way around. Intelligent candidates who value their time dont want to waste years toiling away in a job that isnt a good fit. By asking intelligent questions, you convey to the hiring manager that you want to make sure this job is a good fit for both parties. Lets take a look at some of the best questions potential employees ask to show employers that they are a top candidate.</p><h3><b>Can you describe your company culture?</b></h3><p>This is a good question because it shows an employer that you want to make sure you will fit in. In most cases, the interviewer will have already decided if you will be a good fit or not by this time, but it is still a good question to ask.</p><h3><b>What are the opportunities for personal development?</b></h3><p>Having goals that stretch beyond finding a job is definitely a good thing. By asking this question, you can let a potential employer know that you intend to expand your skill set and are a motivated candidate. It is important to craft your words in a way that implies you intend to stay with the company for the long haul.</p><h3><b>Are there any areas you think I may be lacking in?</b></h3><p>Yes, it takes some bravado to ask this question during an interview, but in most cases it plays out well. This question forces the interviewer to open up about your chances of getting the job. Whats more, it gives you a chance to correct and defend yourself in any areas that appear weak. Asking this question rarely hurts a candidate. As<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/investopedia/2012/10/04/4-essential-questions-to-ask-at-the-end-of-a-job-interview/""> Forbes </a>details, ""It lets you know where you stand and if you need to clarify anything for the interviewer."" </p><h3><b>How does your company measure performance and recognize employees?</b></h3><p>Asking this question demonstrates that you realize how important employee motivation is. According to <a href=""http://jobs.theguardian.com/article/4170853/what-questions-to-ask-at-the-end-of-your-interview/"">The Guardian</a>, by bringing up this subject, ""You can be seen to be someone who understands the value of commitment, reliability and returns."" It is important to remember not to seem like you want a reward after completing each task. The idea is to convey that you intend to excel at your job rather than do the bare minimum.</p><p>Coming prepared with thoughtful questions like these is a great way to complete the end of a job interview and make a good impression. They demonstrate your desire to make sure the job is in line with your career goals, which ultimately is also the objective of the employer.</p><p></p>"Job Search Tips,What to Eat on the Day of a Big Job Interview,"<p></p><h1><b>What to Eat on the Day of a Big Job Interview</b></h1> <p>If you're like most job seekers, you have prepared for job interviews over a specialty coffee, perhaps one full of cream, sugar and other confections. You might also have chosen to eat a jelly doughnut for good measure. Theres a chance that those are interviews you'd rather forget.</p> <p>Along with all the other things you must do to prepare for an interview, the most important is to remember that you are more that what your resume says you are. You are also whatever you had for breakfast or lunch. The food that you put in your stomach can affect your energy in your interview performance.</p> <p>Prepare your body and your mind by eating well before your big meeting. What follows is some great advice from<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121003122209-203080237-foods-for-success-what-should-you-eat-before-the-interview"">Foods for Success</a>, by chef and cookbook author Marcus Samuelsson, and <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/08/31/what-to-eat-before-an-interview"">What to Eat Before an Interview</a> by Miriam Salpeter. Together, they lay out the details on how to spread your table before you break out that spreadsheet for a potential employer.</p><h3><b>Flax your mental muscles</b></h3><p>Foods with flaxseed oil have been used since Roman times to keep minds sharp and focused. Modern medical research says that flax is an ideal source foralpha-linolenic, a fat that enhances performance within the cerebral cortex. Specifically, it facilitates neurons processing sensory input so you can pick up subtle visual clues and truly listen to the questions being asked. Add flaxseed to healthy smoothies or salads.</p><h3><b>Goji for the gold</b></h3><p>Goji berries are the the latest inductee to the list of superfoods that pack tremendous health benefits in a tiny package. Milligram for milligram, goji berries have more beta-carotene than carrots and outperform oranges in vitamin C. The best way to get your goji berries is dried like little raisins or as an invigorating tea to replace coffee.</p> <p></p><h3><b>Play your carbs right</b></h3>Don't let your stomach interrupt your interview with grumblings of its own, no matter how long you had to wait in the lobby. Quinoa is a grain that burns slowly and steadily. A coffee loaded with sweets is going to spike and drop your blood sugar, leading to a lack of concentration and lower energy level. Quinoa is also a rich source of magnesium, which manages stress.<p></p> <p></p><h3><b>Get energized with a lean protein</b></h3><div>Start the day with eggs. Or have salmon for lunch. The key is to nail the <a href=""http://www.fi.edu/learn/brain/fats.html"">right kind of complex fatty acids</a>, like DHA, which will help you feel full and maintain your energy levels throughout the grueling examination of your every flaw and virtue. Eating has a psychological component as well; quality food boosts your self-worth and confidence. Youre going to need them.</div><p></p> <p></p><h3><b>Protect your health and strengthen your mind with Omega-3</b></h3>Theres no question you are going to need extra antioxidants to boost your immune system. You're going to be shaking a lot of hands. The bonus is that vitamins C, E and beta-carotene also improve short-term brain function so you can, say, remember exactly what happened the last time you argued with your boss. Salmon, beans and eggs are rich sources of Omega-3 fatty acids. Sides of kale and lingonberries are healthy winners, too.<p></p> <p>Another tip: Making a great meal for yourself allows time for your subconscious to work on your practice interview answers so they flow out more naturally.</p> <p>If you are already on a specific diet, the day or so leading up to your interview is not the right time to make big diet changes. Even the best foods can throw you off your game as your body adjusts.</p><h3>More Info</h3><p>A slideshow from Medscape on <a href=""http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/brain-food"">how diet affects brain functioning</a> reported results from several recent studies that suggest ""fried, refined, and sugary foods significantly increases risk for depression."" </p><p>If those foods sound familiar it's because they are precisely the comfort foods people normally turn to in the face of sudden stress, such as--wait for it--a job interview.Next time while you are waiting to be called in for your interview, remember that the selections available in the break room vending machine represent the exact opposite of what your system requires to present a winning first impression.</p> <p>Make sure you eat proper foods that fuel your mind and your body before the big job interview so that you can think clearly, stay positive and power your way into a new job.</p><p></p><p></p>"Career,Where Are the Health Care Jobs?,"<h1>Where are the Health Care Jobs?</h1><p>Health care is a secure sector of the economy in which to plan a career. The need for health care workers will only increase as baby boomers age, and health care jobs are difficult to outsource to other parts of the world. One out of every eight jobs in the United States is related to health care, according to the <a href=""http://www.seiu.org/healthcare-jobs/"">Service Employees International Union</a>. Here are a few growing health care jobs to consider:</p><h3>Nursing</h3><p>U.S. News ranks the <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-healthcare-jobs"">top 10 health care jobs</a> each year according to salary, number of openings and opportunity for advancement. <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/registered-nurse"">Registered Nurse</a>is No. 2 job on that list, (after dentists) because of the enormous variety of settings in which nurses can work as well as the solid economic prospects for these opportunities in the coming decade. Nurses are needed in high-tech urban hospitals and small town clinics, in schools and nursing homes, cruise ships and county public health offices. </p><h3>Physical and occupational therapy</h3><p>With a projected growth of 39 percent in the coming decade, physical therapy is a promising career choice. One reason this field is expected to show explosive growth is the fact that a large segment of the U.S. population is becoming elderly, and physical therapists play a major role in helping older people stay active and mobile. The median salary for an occupational therapist is $73,820. For job seekers with less time to invest in professional education, the position of physical therapy assistant is also in the top 10, and these professionals have many of the same duties and perks as full-fledged physical therapists.</p><h3>Dental hygiene and dental assisting</h3><p>Dental care is a financially rewarding field that is expected to grow vigorously over the next decade. Dental hygienists tend to work part-time, and many people enter this field with a two-year post-secondary degree. Dental offices also need dental assistants. They have less specialized skills but usually enjoy the same flexible part-time schedule as dental hygienists. The median salary for dental hygienists is $69,280 and for dental assistants is $34,140.</p><h3>Technologists and technicians</h3>The Bureau of Labor Statistics lists 23 <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home.htm"">health care jobs</a>that require two years or less of college or professional training. Many of these jobs carry the title of ""technologist"" or ""technician,"" and as medical care becomes more complex, such functions are increasingly in demand. For example: Nuclear medicine technologists, radiologic technologists, surgical technologists, medical records technicians, pharmacy technicians.<div><br></div><div>The pathways to entering the health care field have never been more numerous.</div>"Career,Criminal Justice Careers,"<h1>Criminal Justice Careers</h1><p>If you like the idea of helping people by using the law, you might be interested in the field of criminal justice. When you think of this field, police officers, judges and prison guards often come to mind. While these are criminal justice jobs, not all of them are in high demand. If you are intent on entering a field of criminal justice that is growing, take a look at some of these careers. <br></p> <h3>Probation officer </h3> <p>As a probation officer, you would monitor criminals to make sure they do not commit additional crimes. Not only would you have to communicate with criminal offenders, but you would also have to stay up to date on their cases, which would require handling paperwork and keeping in contact with the court. If you think you can perform these tasks, and if you have a bachelor's degree - preferably in psychology, criminal justice or social work - you can become a probation officer. The <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/probation-officers-and-correctional-treatment-specialists.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> claims the growth rate of this career is 18 percent, with a median salary around $47,000. <br></p> <h3>Private detective </h3> <p>If you want an interesting career that makes use of your research skills, consider becoming a private detective. In this job, you will get the chance to do everything from finding missing people to performing background checks for large companies. The demand for private detectives is supposed to increase by about 21 percent by 2020. A college degree is not usually necessary but at least some college or experience conducting investigations can help you land a job. The median salary is about $43,000.</p><h3>Crime Scene Examiner</h3>If the idea of analyzing crime scenes for facts and clues sounds interesting to you, consider a career as a crime scene examiner. This position would require you to go out to crime scenes and carefully collect evidence, which you would then bring back to the lab for a closer look. If you have seen ""Dexter,"" it's sort of what Dexter does, only without the murderous vigilantism. If using science to find answers appeals to you, and if you have a bachelor's degree in forensic or natural science, then you are qualified. According to the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/forensic-science-technicians.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, this field should grow by about 20 percent by 2020, and you can expect to make around $52,000 annually. <h3>Criminal law attorney </h3> <p><a href=""http://work.chron.com/criminal-justice-jobs-demand-us-19419.html"">The Houston Chronicle</a> reports that attorneys willing to handle criminal law will continue to be in demand for years to come. Whether you become a defense attorney or a prosecutor, you will need a degree from law school in order to practice. In return, you can expect a salary of around $100,000 or more. <br></p> <h3>Paralegal </h3> <p>As a paralegal, you would help lawyers with their cases, often by preparing legal documents. In fact, many paralegals can do the same tasks as most lawyers, with the major difference being that they cannot practice law by themselves or present cases in court. So if you are interested in dealing with the law but lack the time or money for law school, you might consider this career. It is expected to grow by about 18 percent by 2020. This is one of the few criminal justice careers requiring just an associate's degree to start.

Repeated job posts can mean several things:</div><div><ul><li>The job has a high turnover rate because of insufficient training, low pay or other problems</li><li>The recruiter made a technological error</li><li>The job search board is trying to inflate the number of openings it has.</li></ul><div>According to the <a href=""http://www.cluewagon.com/2009/08/5-reasons-the-employer-re-posted-the-ad/"">Clue Wagon blog</a>, recruiters sometimes re-post jobs because they're not good workplaces and people leave after just a month or two.

It should be concise, yet engaging. It needs a good hook or lead and should be specifically customized for the position for which you're applying. Peppering the document with fancy bells and whistles is not necessary. Finding the right balance between showcasing your talents and using sales language is difficult, but remember: the resume is your first impression. According to the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/allbusiness/AB3905880_tip.html"">New York Times</a>, ""if your resume doesn't spell out your unique ability to perform the job for which you're applying, you won't be asked in for an interview."" Here are seven ways to put your best foot forward when writing a resume.</p><p></p><h3><b>1. Less is more</b></h3><p>Don't include any information that isnt relevant to the job for which youre applying. In other words, if youre applying for a position as a teacher, dont waste a section talking about how you once worked in the food industry, unless you can draw relevant parallels between the two. While we want to highlight every single one of our talents and skills, an employer doesnt want to read a resume saturated with irrelevant details. </p><p></p><h3><b>2. No jargon</b></h3><p>Words like ""game changer"" and ""team player"" are generic. These words are called resume jargon and using them in your resume does nothing to set you apart from other candidates. </p><p></p><h3><b>3. Organization and grammar</b></h3><p>Start with an objective statement that includes what job youre applying for and why you think youre a good fit. After that, describe your work history. Conclude the resume with your education. Most resumes are one to two pages long. Check for typos and grammatical errors. </p><p></p><h3><b>4. Don't use fancy fonts</b></h3><p>A resume is a professional document, so it needs to look clean, sharp and straightforward. Unusual fonts with frilly letters might look good for the collection of poems youre working on, but that type of stylistic expression is going to grab the attention of an employer in the worst way possible. </p><p></p><h3><b>5. Sounding professional</b></h3><p>This is the real trick to writing a good resume. It's easy to rely on conventional templates for this type of business document; however, the best resumes find some way to be more personable and creative. It's not only about the information you're sharing but how you share it. Use your voice.</p><p></p><h3><b>6. Accuracy</b></h3><p>Make sure the job titles are correct, as well as the dates during which you were employed. If an employer finds inaccuracies, your attention to detail will come into question, and it could jeopardize your chance of receiving a phone call for an interview. </p><p></p><h3><b>7. Make sure your resume is rich in keywords</b></h3><p>Today resumes are sent to employers electronically, where a database might store applicant resumes digitally. When employers do a search for potential candidates, their search is based on keywords. If you want your resume to come up when employers access the database, then it needs to be rich in relevant keywords. </p><p></p><p>When you sit down to write a resume, skip the wordiness and fanciness, and save the linen paper for another occasion. A streamlined, professional document with a good hook will get your foot in the door.</p>"Interviews,What to Bring With You to a Job Interview,"<p></p><h1>What to Bring with You to a Job Interview</h1><p>As you prepare for your next job interview, make sure you bring a few essentials to the meeting. These essentials include documents that will help you look and feel prepared and that might even increase your chances of getting the job. Here are five items to bring with you to a job interview. <br></p> <h3>Copies of your resume and cover letter </h3> <p>You might assume that the company already has these documents, but the person interviewing you may not have them printed out. If he or she wants to refer to your resume or cover letter during the interview, it's always nice for you to be able to supply a copy. In fact, according to <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2013/07/29/are-you-bringing-the-right-documents-to-job-interviews-find-out/"">Forbes</a>, you might actually want to bring four or five copies because you could end up getting an impromptu meeting with other department supervisors. It is always nice to leave behind copies of your resume and cover letter for anyone who asks, rather than having to email these documents to them later. <br></p> <h3>References </h3> <p>If you have the common phrase ""references upon request"" in your resume, now is the time to make good on that statement. Even if the employer did not specifically ask for your references ahead of time, the interviewer might ask for them when you arrive. Have the contact information of a few references neatly typed up and be sure to bring a few copies just in case. <br></p> <h3>Portfolio </h3> <p>In some fields, a portfolio is just as important as a resume and cover letter. According to <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/06/25/5-things-to-bring-on-your-next-interview"">U.S. News & World Report</a>, a portfolio is especially useful for creatives, such as graphic artists. You should print logos or website designs you have created, and you can bring photographs as well. Sales professionals can benefit from portfolios, too. Graphs provide a great way to show your stats, such as sales goals you have reached. If your work revolves around the written word, your portfolio should include articles, essays or blog posts. <br></p> <h3>Paper and pen </h3> <p>You will likely be given information you will need to write down during your interview. Even if you do not find out anything new, taking notes shows your interviewer that you are not only prepared but also truly interested in what they have to say. <br></p> <h3>Identification </h3> <p>If your job interview goes well and you are offered the job on the spot, you will need your identification in order to fill out documents. Make the process fast and easy by bringing your driver's license and social security card to the job interview. You might also want to bring your passport as a second form of photo identification. When you bring everything you need to fill out the necessary documents, it's one less thing to worry about during your first day on the job.</p>"Interviews,How to Recruit for Work from Home Jobs,"<h1>How to Recruit for Work from Home Jobs</h1><p>Work-from-home jobs are different than office jobs. Employers don't see their employees every day, so factors such as work ethic, trust and organization are at an absolute premium. Because of this, recruiting virtual workers is a slightly different animal than recruiting traditional office workers. So let's take a quick walk through how to recruit work from home jobs.</p><h3>Step 1: Advertise clearly</h3><p>As with all jobs, you'll want to create an attractive, succinct job advertisement. Clearly describe the skills and the work environment required. Consider the attributes that make for a successful home-based worker. They should be independent enough to work successfully on their own, but they also need to be good at working with others in remote locations in order to build their skills, keep up with relevant information and take part in projects. As far as environment goes, people who work from home need stable Internet access, a phone line and a quiet work space. Specifying the environmental factors that are required is important, especially if the worker will be talking to clients or customers.</p><h3>Step 2: Recruit actively</h3><p>Your best candidates might not be seeking employment actively. Many people freelance in order to enjoy the benefits of working from home. These workers look for clients, but they dont necessarily look for employers. If you want them to join your team, you should go to where they are and reach out to them the same way their old clients have.</p><p>Social media or <a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/199672"">recruiting 2.0</a> is the easiest way to find the potential employees whom youre looking for when theyre not looking for you. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/business/smallbusiness/online-recruiting-efforts-gain-ground.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"">LinkedIn provides employers</a> with ""one centralized place to find the vast majority of qualified candidates."" You can send candidates a link to your job advertisement.</p><p>When you recruit candidates to fill your work-from-home jobs, you will find that many of the best candidates are already comfortable doing their own thing. Dont assume they wont be interested in working for you. Instead, create an appealing advertisement that will convince them that your opportunity is worth their time.<br></p><h3>Step 3: Vet thoroughly</h3><p><a></a>Vet your new hires thoroughly. Most work-from-home positions are made possible by mobile technologies. Your work-from-home employees accessyour information systems from their homes. Not only must you trust them with access to your network, but they must also understand and abide by the security policies that keep your network secure. Check their understanding of technology and commitment to policies during the interview process.</p>"Career,Find Good Part-Time Workers,"<h1><b>How to Find Good Part-Time Workers</b></h1><div>An increasing number of jobs are falling short of the standard full-time work week of 40 hours. Why? Hiring part-time workers saves money and increases flexibility for companies. Are there differences between hiring part-time workers and full-time workers? Yes, small but important ones.</div><h3>Finding part-time workers</h3><div><p>Recruiters target different demographics when hiring part-time rather than full-time employees. The part-time workforce tends to include young people juggling study and work, and it also includes working parents and older people approaching or in retirement. As a result, different approaches are needed to reach out to these potential candidates.</p></div><p>College students are often well-suited to part-time work. They have free time between classes, in the evenings and on weekends and are often looking for work during the busy summer season. The downside is that these young people often lack experience, so businesses must set aside time to train them. Although students cannot always provide references from previous employers, recruiters can ask to see references from teachers to get an idea of the student's reliability and character.</p><p>High school students are another option, but companies must be aware of child <a href=""http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/5-things-you-need-know-now-about-hiring-temporary-workers-2012-holiday-season"">labor laws</a>. Minors cannot legally work in hazardous roles, and there are strict limits on the number of hours that those under 16 can work. U.S. laws prevent 14- and 15-year-olds from working more than three hours on a school day, or eight hours a day on the weekend. Some states place additional restrictions on part-time work for teenagers.</p><p>Because many people seeking part-time work are among the young digital generation, advertising online is a good way to reach out to potential candidates. Job search engines such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> are convenient online venues to advertise an available position.</p><h3>Considerations when advertising and interviewing for for part-time positions</h3><p>Many job seekers see part-time work as temporary. Part-time jobs are often used to finance study or as a stopgap while looking for full-time employment. Businesses that require more stable part-timers should be clear when advertising as to whether they are looking for a permanent employee or one that can fill a <a href=""http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/workforce-management-hiring-consulting/1010-1.html"">seasonal position</a>.</p><p>Because many part-time job applicants are planning to balance the job with their other commitments, it's important to find out what their available hours are during the interview. Employers must remember not to ask illegal interview questions, such as inquiries about family life, age or childbearing plans. Interviewers can ask candidates about their career goals, the hours they are available each week and their motivations for applying to the job.</p><h3>Hiring Freelancers Instead of Employing Part-Time Workers</h3><div>Instead of taking on part-time workers as employees, many companies are outsourcing work to freelancers. A<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/jan/21/outsource-work-to-freelancers-online-sme"">2013 poll by The Guardian</a> found that 79 percent of business respondents regard freelancers as a key component of their business strategy. This is a very flexible option for the employer, and it can lead to stable, long-term contracts between freelancers and the companies they work for. Freelancers in almost every field can be found online; many of the top established freelancers have their own websites or LinkedIn profiles that outline their skills and experience. Try searching LinkedIn and <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> to find freelancers who have specific specialist skills.</div><h3>Rules governing part-time workers</h3><p>Many of the rights that apply to full-time staff also apply when hiring someone on a part-time basis. Before hiring part-time workers, employers should take the time to familiarize themselves with the rules regarding part-time worker rights.</p><div><ul><li>Part-time employees must be paid at least minimum wage.</li><li>Part-time workers are entitled to meal and rest breaks.</li><li>Part-timers may be entitled to benefits such as holiday pay if they work enough hours in the year to qualify.</li><li>Businesses are required to carry worker's compensation insurance for part-time staff.</li><li>Tax withholding rules apply to part-time workers, even if they are only seasonal employees</li></ul><div><p>Good part-time help is plentiful if you know where to look and treat your workers fairly.</p></div></div>"Interviews,Recruiting Red Flags,"<h1>Recruiting Red Flags</h1><p>When youre in the process of screening applicants for a job, you have to look for the subtle signals that let you know when a person is not right for the position. What are some of the recruiting red flags you should keep an eye out for? Here are a few of the classic ones.</p><h3>Resume errors and exaggerations</h3><p>Regardless of the type of position youre seeking to fill, accuracy is an important characteristic of a good worker. Of course, everyone makes mistakes sometimes, but some mistakes carry more weight than others. A typo or spelling error on a resume is evidence of more than simple carelessness; it shows an absence of judgment. Chris Field, an HR professional, also <a href=""http://www.smartrecruiters.com/blog/4-resume-red-flags/"">points out</a> that its important to watch for exaggerations of job duties on resumes. He warns employers to check into claims such as ""managed all processes"" or ""trained all employees.""</p><h3>Too much focus on the money</h3><p>Of course the need to earn money is one of the main reasons why anyone looks for work, but it should not come across as the only reason. If a job candidate says that an insufficient salary was the main reason he or she left a previous job, that attitude spells trouble. The person may very well do the same thing again, moving on from the position with your company as soon as s/he is offered something better. Even more irritating, candidates solely motivated by money may not even want the position for which youre interviewing them. They may only be fishing for a job offer in order to use it to negotiate a higher salary at their present place of employment.</p><h3>Inappropriate or negative disclosures</h3><p>This heading can encompass a variety of missteps, from the applicant who tells you the nature of the personal surgery they just had, to the one who embarks on a tirade against their previous employer. Generally, part of the information you glean from the interview process consists of what the candidate chooses not to say. If an applicant shares too much of the wrong kind of information, thats a clear signal that some basic judgment and intuitive sense of the workplace is missing. Obviously, this also applies to any inappropriate material posted on a candidates social media profile.</p><h3>Not enough passion</h3><p>Ilya Pozin, writing for<a href=""http://www.inc.com/ilya-pozin/recruiting-hiring-how-to-find-the-best-employees.html"">Inc.com</a>, suggests that interviewers should make sure candidates ""exhibit clear dedication to your company."" A candidate who hasnt taken the trouble to learn even the basics about your business isnt likely to change his or her habits once hired. Interview responses should never be generic. Its a recruiting red flag if you get the impression that the applicant is simply looking for any old job. Listen for indications that the candidate is specifically happy to work for your business, and see if they can give you some specific reasons behind their eagerness.</p>"Interviews,How to Recruit on College Campuses,"<h1>How to Recruit on College Campuses</h1><p>When you want to hire younger workers who have an education, colleges are a great source. If you recruit on college campuses, you can attract bright, energetic candidates who are just entering your field. But not every company knows the ins and outs of recruiting on college campuses. Here are some tips.</p><h3>What do you have to offer?</h3><p>According to <a href=""http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/09/how-to-recruit-on-college-campuses.html#/guides/2010/09/how-to-recruit-on-college-campuses.html"">Evan Klonsky</a>, ""Companies, especially small and growing companies, should realize they are in a position to offer employees a lot of room to grow."" This is a key attribute thats going to help you attract top students from colleges near you. Instead of squeezing top candidates in at the bottom, offer candidates real responsibilities and follow through on these promises.</p><p>By recruiting on campus, you can network with local college students and attract young professional candidates. According to Klonsky, your biggest challenge may be making your organization attractive enough to compete for the candidates you most want to hire. Focusing on your strengths, advertising creatively, offering perks and using social media to your advantage are just a few of the things you can do to give your organization an edge.</p><h3>Working with the college</h3><p>Recruiting on campus requires some organization. According to <a href=""http://coe.berkeley.edu/corporate-relations/campus-recruiting.html"">Berkeleys School of Engineering</a>, the best place to start is the colleges Corporate Relations Office. Follow the colleges unique rules to maximize cooperation.</p><p><a href=""http://web.ccis.edu/en/Offices/CampusLife/CareerServices/OnCampusRecruiting.aspx"">Columbia College</a> lists detailed policies and procedures. If you follow them, you get access to their support staff, which can help you access students, provide a more inclusive applicant pool, pre-screen applicants whove expressed interest in your positions and extend offers for candidates to consider.</p><p><a></a>You may also want to reach out to the professors who teach the subject your candidates need to know. A positive relationship with well-placed professors could offer the insight you need to access the best candidates year in and out.</p><h3>Trial arrangements</h3><p>One of the advantages to recruiting on college campuses is the ability to create trial opportunities for candidates. By working with local universities to create internships that meet students needs, you can hire temporary employees who require less compensation while vetting them for future positions. This is a win-win opportunity that gives both you and your ideal candidates a chance to find the right fit before either of you makes a long-term decision.</p><p>A relationship with a college and its students, formed by an internship opportunity, will also give you more leverage when seeking the colleges cooperation in attracting their best and brightest students.</p><p>What students lack in bona fide experience they make up for in energy, enthusiasm and innovation. Theyre fresh out of college and apply what they have learned. Give them room to grow, and youll find that recruiting on college campuses can net you the types of rising stars every company needs.</p><p></p>"Career,What a Candidate's Social Media Accounts Say About Them,"<h1>What a Candidate's Social Media Account Says About Them</h1><div><p>A <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/04/16/how-social-media-can-help-or-hurt-your-job-search/"">sizable majority</a> of job seekers have social media accounts. Job seekers can use social media to make business connections and learn about job opportunities. They can also unwittingly reveal a lot about themselves. As this<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/OnDevice/young-peoples-consumer-confidence-index-22121437""> study</a>from On Device shows, the majority of young adults worldwide do not think about how social media can hurt their job prospects, even though an estimated 10 percent have lost a job opportunity because of inappropriate postings. You can use social media information when evaluating potential job candidates. It often says a lot about a candidate.</p></div><h3>Weed out problem candidates</h3><div><p>Some candidates put on their best faces at interviews but have serious problems that interfere with the ability to do their jobs. Sometimes you can learn about these problems by checking out a candidate's social media accounts.</p></div><div><ul><li>Candidates with drug and alcohol problems may post pictures of themselves drinking, write incoherent statuses while intoxicated or talk about their drug and alcohol use with their friends.</li><li>Candidates who are bigoted might write racist, homophobic or misogynistic statuses.</li><li>Candidates who don't respect authority might write statuses making fun of their old boss or complaining about police, teachers or other authority figures.</li></ul><div>Some recruiters <a href=""http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/06/03/what-your-social-media-reputation-says-to-employers/"">look through candidates' online photos</a> and recent statuses to make sure they don't raise any red flags before continuing with the hiring process.</div></div><h3>Gauge how the candidate fits into the company culture</h3><div><p>Social media can give you a glimpse into intangible qualities, such as personality, humor and interests. By examining candidates' social media accounts, you can begin to see whether the candidate fits into your company's culture.<br></p></div><div><ul><li>Statuses, posted photos and groups the candidate joins show what his or her personal interests and hobbies are.</li><li>Jokes, or lack thereof, show the candidate's sense of humor, type of humor and whether humor is important to him or her.</li><li>The type and number of events joined shows how social the candidate is and whether or not he or she enjoys the kinds of events others in your company enjoy.</li><li>The tone of posts gives an idea how optimistic or pessimistic the candidate tends to be, as well as whether he or she is sarcastic, lacks compassion or is difficult to get along with.</li></ul><h3>Determine the candidate's qualifications</h3></div><div><p>Candidates who are looking for jobs often use social media professionally. They may talk about books or articles they've read or written, or they may join professional groups online.</p></div><div><p>If you want to get a sense of how qualified a candidate is for a job, don't just look at his or her social media posts. Look at the candidate's interactions with others in groups and on his or her page. Check out whether the candidate's posts demonstrate professionalism and expert knowledge. You should also read any blog posts the candidate has written to see whether he or she has writing skills and good grammar.</p></div><h3>Evaluate the candidate's communication skills</h3><div><p>Social media has turned everyone into a writer to a certain extent. This gives you the opportunity to evaluate the candidate's written communication skills. Through reading the candidate's posts, you can determine things like:</p></div><div><ul><li>How well the candidate spells</li><li>Whether proofreading is important to the candidate</li><li>The candidate's ability to get a point across</li><li>Whether the candidate pays attention to how he or she says things</li></ul></div><div><p>Social media doesn't tell you the entire story about a candidate, but it does say a lot more than many candidates realize.</p></div>"Career,Do College Majors Matter?,"<h1>Do College Majors Matter?<br></h1><p>In some fields, having a degree is essential. For example, you must study the law to be a lawyer. Likewise, if you intend to have a career as a geologist, majoring in geology is important. At the other end of the spectrum, a lot of college majors dont really set you up for a career in any distinct field. Majoring in English does not make becoming a successful author much easier. Many journalists didn't study journalism. Many small business owners do not have business degrees or MBAs. Lets take a look at how college majors affect employment, as well as careers that require specific majors and ones that dont.</p><h3>College majors and unemployment</h3><p>Does it really matter whether you majored in philosophy or art history once you graduate? Not directly. Few people actually manage to get paid to work in those fields. That doesnt mean time spent studying in college was wasted. The bulk of liberal arts majors learn skills that are essential to long-term success  things like creative thinking and effective communication. </p><p></p><p>Here's the problem with majoring in a subject that's not valuable to the market. Competition is actually higher for jobs that dont require specific majors. According to <a href=""http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/hpi/cew/pdfs/Unemployment.Final.update1.pdf"">a study</a> by Georgetown University, ""Majors that are more closely aligned with particular occupations and industries tend to experience lower unemployment rates.""</p><p>To illustrate this concept, consider these two scenarios: A recent college graduate earns a degree in accounting and takes the CPA exam. He or she will most likely apply for jobs in the accounting field requiring CPA certification. This graduate will compete only with candidates who also have their CPA licenses.<br></p><p>Now consider a second graduate who majored in philosophy and earned a bachelor's degree. This job-seeker will quickly find that getting a job in the philosophy field will most likely require at least a master's degree, if not a doctorate. He or she will then likely apply for general jobs that attract hundreds or even thousands of applicants all coming from various fields of study that have no straightforward career path. While this graduate may have some desirable skills that employers want, it will be harder to get noticed. The sheer number of applicants for each job will make landing a decent job much more difficult.<br></p><p></p><h3>Where college majors matter</h3><ul><li>Engineering</li><li>Healthcare</li><li>Physical sciences</li><li>Pharmacy science</li><li>Computer science</li><li>Education</li></ul><p>Not only is it usually easier to find a job with a major in a field that is associated with an occupation, but the pay is often much higher as well. With the exception of education, college students majoring in fields such as those mentioned above can also expect to earn significantly more than average. <br></p><h3>Where majors dont matter so much</h3><p>Unlike majors that lead to obvious careers, many liberal arts majors leave students with a wide range of options upon graduation. Higher education researcher <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/abby-miller/does-major-really-matter_b_2805741.html"">Abby Miller</a>highlights the benefits of these types of degrees: ""The original intent of a liberal arts degree is not to prepare you for a career, but rather to broaden your mind, and train you to analyze and communicate.""</p><p>While job seekers often complain about how hard it is to find decent jobs with a degree such as philosophy, recruiters tell a different story. Top employers actually seek out candidates who are creative, can think on their feet and have superb communication skills. </p><h3>Separate yourself from the pack</h3><p>While employers say they seek out graduates with liberal arts college majors, getting yourself in front of companies for an interview can be tough. In order to land top jobs, graduates must put their newly acquired collegiate skills to work in the job search phase. Just getting your resume noticed takes ingenuity. Those who find creative ways to leverage their network and make their resumes stand out do not lack for opportunities.</p><p></p><p></p><p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/abby-miller/does-major-really-matter_b_2805741.html""></a></p><p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/abby-miller/does-major-really-matter_b_2805741.html""></a></p>"Interviews,What Recruiters Look for in a Cover Letter,"<h1><b>What Recruiters Should Look for in a Cover Letter</b></h1><p>Today recruiters rely on automated screening, such as <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/corinne-mills/congratulations-youre-vir_b_3753027.html"">recruitment software</a>that searches for resume keywords. That technology, along with other digital processes, filters the vast numbers of resumes they receive. As a result, you may never see the majority of resumes submitted to your company. For this reason, despite the fact that many recruiters <a href=""http://hrdave.com/2011/06/28/opinions-are-like-cover-letters-%E2%80%93-everybody-has-one-and-most-of-them-are-wrong/"">do not read cover letters</a>, it is more important than ever to pay significant attention to the cover letters that do reach you. This is where you are likely to find insights into applicants' personalities and attributes that are not apparent on their resumes.</p><p>Look for the following traits in those applying for jobs in your human resources department:</p><p></p><ul><li>The ability and willingness to listen to others.

But even employers can make major mistakes when attempting to move forward the wheels of labor. Here are some examples of job post FAILs you should definitely avoid imitating. <br></p> <h3><b>Incredibly long posting with a single paragraph </b></h3> <p>When you take a look at a this job posting listed on <a href=""http://worstjobpostingsever.blogspot.com/2011/04/its-simple-really.html#more"">Worst Job Postings Ever</a>, you can immediately see the issue. The listing for Mobile Graphic Designer includes nearly 1,000 words with no separate sections, all in one paragraph! If you want anyone to read your ad, it should be somewhat appealing to the eye. You would not want to read a resume that was this long without several paragraphs and bullet points, so don't make job candidates do it, either. This block of text right here is about 100 words. Now multiply it times 10 with no breaks.<br></p> <h3><b>Not enough information </b></h3> <p>Another posting mentioned on <a href=""http://worstjobpostingsever.blogspot.com/2011/03/this-wins-prize-for-shortest-job-post.html"">Worst Job Postings Ever</a> has the opposite problem in that it is far too short. It simply says, ""Hygiene part time Thursday in a periodontal practice."" While most job applicants can probably assume what the job title is, the listing lacks an official job description, job requirements or any mention of salary. It definitely does not instill a sense of confidence in anyone who views the ad, as it does not look very professional. You might want to avoid that particular dental practice on Thursdays as well.<br></p> <h3><b>Nonsensical </b></h3> <p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/12/19-more-crazy-craigslist-ads_n_758718.html#slide=154307"">The Huffington Post</a> mentioned an ad that not only has too little information, but is also grammatically incorrect. It reads, ""We need a smart or more person to help un with our Company."" A post like this won't exactly attract the best applicants, if it gets any responses at all. If you are thinking of placing an ad like this, don't un with it.<br></p> <h3><b>Discriminatory </b></h3> <p>You think it would go without saying, but you should make sure your job posting is not discriminatory or illegal. Apparently at least one business in Australia is not aware of this. According to News Online from Australia (<a href=""http://www.news.com.au/business/your-business/no-indians-asians-job-advertisement-causes-outrage-coles/story-fn9evb64-1226459746133"">news.com.au</a>), a company had a job ad that mentioned, ""Store requires no indians or asians please. MUST SPEAK ENGLISH (sic)."" Obviously there was some backlash from the public, including a boycott and possibly even legal action. The business claimed a contract company it hired actually posted the ad, so another lesson from this job posting disaster is to only allow someone you trust to post job ads. <br></p> <h3><b>Unprofessional all around </b></h3> <p><a href=""http://www.trendingbuffalo.com/life/digital-finds/the-worst-job-posting-on-buffalo-craigslist-this-week/"">Trending Buffalo</a> dissected the many things wrong with one of the job post FAILs found on Craigslist. The ad was vague when it came to describing the job and what little was described seemed illegal. It also had typos and an unprofessional email address to boot. Overall, this ad is a great example of what NOT to do when you need to hire someone. If your job posting sounds or is illegal, it's always best to rewrite it.</p>"Job Search Tips,Avoid Jargon When Posting Jobs,"<div><h1>Avoid Jargon When Posting Jobs</h1></div><p>Getting the wording to job advertisements right helps attract candidates who can excel in the roles you intend to fill. Unfortunately, many job postings on online job boards are filled with jargon that does not communicate much about the position or the employer. By taking a little more time to carefully write job postings, rather than relying on overused jargon, recruiters can attract a better pool of applicants and avoid causing confusion.</p><h3>Jargon is off-putting</h3><p><a href=""http://hiring.monster.co.uk/hr/hr-best-practices/market-intelligence/labour-statistics-trends/job-jargon-infographic.aspx"">A poll conducted by Monster.com</a> revealed some disturbing facts regarding the way that job seekers perceive jargon.</p><div><ul><li>One-third of job seekers find industry jargon confusing.</li><li>60 percent find jargon annoying.</li><li>More than half are put off from applying for a job if the posting uses jargon.</li></ul></div><p>By causing confusion among potential applicants about what the role entails, jargon-using recruiters can inadvertently exclude capable people from the pool of candidates.</p><h3>Say what you mean</h3><p>One of the main problems with industry jargon is that you can fall into the trap of lazily reaching for stock terms and phrases without pausing to consider what they mean. Try to explain the role and its requirements using plain English. Using jargon can be a sign that employers are not sure what type of job seeker they want. Recruiters who find themselves falling into this trap should spend more time considering what their organization needs.</p><h3>Use jargon only when necessary</h3><p>There are circumstances where jargon is needed. For example, if a requirement of the job is that a candidate must possess a certain qualification or be familiar with a particular piece of software, then the relevant terms obviously need to be included. In these cases, using industry jargon weeds out candidates who do not have the relevant skills, qualifications or experience.</p><h3>What about acronyms and abbreviations?</h3><p>Job descriptions that are densely packed with industry terms are difficult to read; <a href=""http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobposter/small-business/article.aspx?articleid=ATL_0083BETTERJOBPOSTINGS"">overuse of abbreviations</a> can look unprofessional. If an acronym is widely used in the industry, you may be able to use it without causing confusion in your candidates, but in general, it is best to spell out what you want as clearly as possible.</p><p>When posting on online job sites, such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>, candidates find job postings by searching for relevant keywords, so include these search terms in full in your job title or description. For example, even though a candidate searching for a Registered Nurse position will understand the acronym RN, they might not find your job posting if you do not include the full job title.</p><h3>Avoid jargon, get results</h3><p>A successful job posting includes a clear description of the role and the requirements to apply for the job. Using plain English as much as possible can broaden the pool of applicants and avoid causing confusion. Banish unnecessary jargon from your job postings today and start communicating clearly with candidates.</p>"Career,Eliminate Unmotivated Candidates,"<h1>4 Ways to Quickly Eliminate Unmotivated Candidates<br></h1><p>Anyone who has posted a job opening within the last few years knows that you can almost always expect a flood of applications. When you add the fact that most HR departments are overextended, the need to quickly and efficiently sift through candidates becomes critical. With a bit of creativity, you can eliminate unmotivated candidates and spend more time on the job seekers who deserve it. Here are four ways to eliminate unmotivated candidates.<br></p><h3>1. Be clear about the requirements in the job description</h3><p>The best place to begin knocking out unmotivated candidates is right in the job description. State clearly what is expected, including the ability to go above and beyond to complete tasks. Unmotivated job seekers usually realize when they are getting in over their heads and will move on to the next job posting. It is better to overstate the workload of the job you need filled in order to attract capable, eager applicants. Having said that, make sure you don't set the bar too high. Automatic applicant screening software can eliminate candidates who would be ideal if you require every criteria to be met. According to the<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304821304577436172660988042.html"">Wall Street Journal</a>, hiring companies often try too hard to find the perfect candidate: ""Managers pile up so many requirements that they make it nearly impossible to find anyone who fits.""</p><h3>2. Warn applicants how long the process will take</h3><p>Another great way to stop unmotivated job seekers in their tracks is to give a warning at the beginning of the online application process stating how long it will take. Forty-five minutes will eliminate a percentage of lazy people. Some employers take it even further by requiring two or more hours to complete the initial online application. The reasoning here is that a truly motivated employee who knows they are a good fit for the position should be willing to devote serious time to this process. </p><h3>3. Weed out generic cover letters</h3><p>One of the best places to catch unmotivated candidates is the cover letter. A surprisingly large percentage of job seekers use the same cover letter for every application, substituting a few words here and there. A well-written cover letter should include a paragraph explaining why the candidate is the best choice for the position, covering specific details of the job and company. It should also highlight some of the ways that the candidate intends to solve problems for the company. The resume <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/03/10-ways-the-job-search-has-changed_n_3533836.html"">shouldfocus</a> on the employer's needs rather than the applicant's.<br></p><h3>4. Include custom questions in the application</h3><p>Many job seekers use the ""shotgun approach,"" which is applying to as many jobs as they can in the hopes of having something stick. These tend to be exactly the types of employees you want to eliminate, since they just want to land any job that they can. One way to catch them is to insert long-form question fields into the application. Motivated applicants will give these questions serious thought and provide well-written answers. This strategy will eliminate unmotivated candidates who are likely to do the bare minimum so that they can move on to their next application.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Career,The Case for Going Easy on Required Job Experience,"<h1>The Case for Going Easy on Required Job Experience</h1><p>You want your job ad to attract qualified applicants, but you dont want to sort through a multitude of unqualified respondents. You might think listing excessive required job experience will achieve your goal, but it might not be to your benefit.</p><h3>Whats the problem?</h3><p>If youre having trouble locating qualified applicants, then your job posting might be the problem. According to <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303643304579107793132873508.html"">The Wall Street Journal's Lauren Weber</a>, ""Ads today are long, dull, cluttered with clichs like must be a team player, and overloaded with job requirements, many of which arent truly necessary.""</p><p>If this sounds like your ads, then you have two problems:</p><ol start=""1""><li>Qualified applicants are eliminating themselves based on your excessive required job experience</li><li>Qualified applicants are skipping over your ad to consider shorter, more attractive advertisements</li></ol><p>People are busy, especially when theyre looking for a new job while working for their current employer. They dont have time to waste on ridiculously long or complicated advertisements.</p><h3>What do you really need?</h3><p>According to <a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/56394"">Entrepreneur</a>, ""Before you write your job ad, complete a job analysis and description."" This way, youll know what you really need. At this stage, youre looking for key skills and attributes that enable your workers to get the job done.</p><p>Next, consider what is required to develop those key skills and attributes. Education, training and experience are all likely factors, but before you decide this is what you need your new hire to have, you should consider the kind of training your organization provides.</p><p>What would you rather teach your new hire yourself? What do you expect them to know their first day on the job? What is the absolute minimum you need? What else would be reasonable? List your required job experience while keeping these questions in mind.</p><h3>Drafting the job posting</h3><p>Start by focusing on what you want from an applicant. <a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/56394"">Entrepreneur</a> suggests you ""look at your job specifications and pull out the top four or five skills that are most essential to the job."" List your absolute minimum and your most important first day expectations.Youll probably discover that these abilities arent necessarily dependent on the experience factors you originally used. The best skills to list are those that cant be faked in an interview, which is why experts advise against focusing on personality traits.</p><p><a></a>Determine the level of experience required to meet your expectations. When you write requirements, stick to education and on-the-job experience. Dont go overboard. You want to attract qualified applicants, but you dont want to make your requirements so stringent that you eliminate people who could do the job well.</p><h3>Attracting the right applicants</h3><p>Now that you know what you need and you have put it into words, its time to turn the focus to your applicants. <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303643304579107793132873508.html"">Weber</a> says, ""A good job description should be a zippy 300 words or fewer, conveying a clear picture of the position as well as a sense of the employers culture.""</p><p>Youre trying to attract qualified applicants while also discouraging unqualified applicants with your ad. The keyword here is ""ad."" This is a job ad, true, but its still an advertisement. Make your organization attractive in order to get applicants interested. Make the position clear to discourage unqualified individuals. </p><p>By trimming your required job experience to the essential skills and abilities you need, along with the education and experience levels you expect, youll be able to attract job applicants who are not wasting their time or yours.</p><p></p>"Job Search Tips,Spelling Counts When Posting Jobs,"<h1>Spelling Counts When Posting Jobs</h1><div>As a recruiter, you want to put your best foot forward when posting jobs.

This kind of stress is counter-productive for recruiters who need a comprehensive view of the candidates' skills and potential, which is why it's important to know how to put job candidates at ease.</p><p>There is no question that interviews by nature are stressful. In fact, seeing how the candidate will perform under pressure is a factor for recruiters who have to make long-term decisions within a very short span of time. But for a better understanding of how the candidate will perform on a daily basis, it is important to relieve some of that stress and solicit candid answers. </p> <p>Why go to the trouble? Bad hiring decisions are extremely expensive. <a href=""http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/video-interviews-for-recruitment/"">The Undercover Recruiter</a>released some sobering statistics on the high cost of bad hiring decisions:</p> <p></p><ul><li>On average, it requires 45 days to complete the hiring process<br></li><li>Over that time, it costs the company between $1,300 to $5000 per hire<br></li><li>Turnover costs up to four times the annual salary of the employee<br></li><li>25 percent of companies said bad hiring practices cost them over $50,000<br></li><li>According to Harvard, 80 percent of turnover is due to mistakes in hiring<br></li></ul><p></p> <p>Here are five ways to put job candidates at ease and find the best person for the job:</p> <h3><b>The fuzzy slipper interview</b></h3><p>Phone interviews may seem impersonal, but they go a long way towards helping recruiters narrow down a large pool of candidates who are able to answer questions comfortably in their own homes. For candidates who are used to hearing that recruiters make up their minds in six seconds or less based on initial appearances, phone interviews are a much better chance of making their case on merit over superficiality. The compromise between the two is the <a href=""http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/video-interviews-for-recruitment/"">video interview</a> over web-based software such as Skype and Google Hangout, which have gained popularity in streamlining the hiring process.</p><h3><b>Green is good for your eyes</b></h3><p>How many interviews are conducted in cell-like rooms with harsh lights and bare walls? Or worse, how many candidates face a window overlooking a busy street full of distractions? Next time try a room with some color and plants. If it has to be by a window, pick one with trees or calming scenery. ""Researchers have long found that nature can be an antidote to stress,""according to a study on the<a href=""http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/natdrive.htm"">calming effect of nature</a>conducted by researchers at Ohio State University. See what a difference a little green makes.</p> <h3><b>Making a personal connection</b></h3><p>To the candidate, the recruiter represents faceless management. Recruiters too often dispense with small talk or take notes during this introductory phase in the name of efficiency. As long as the recruiter is seen as the organization, rather than a person, the candidate's answers will be guarded and diplomatic. Talk about yourself outside your professional role as a way to make it a conversation instead of an interrogation.</p> <h3><b>No surprises</b></h3><p>Great interviews occur with well-prepared candidates who dont have to deal with tricks or uncertainties. Its common for companies to have surprise panel interviews or to be vague about who will be doing the interview. These tactics reveal how the candidate deals with the unexpected, but it does so at the cost of learning their best qualities. The candidate should be able to prepare for the interview properly.</p> <h3><b>Build their confidence</b></h3><p>Not every job is sales. The enthusiastic extrovert makes a great interviewer, but some of the best employees are shy and introspective. Great interviews usually result from people who know how to interview well. For the quiet ones, draw them out with complimenting an achievement or talking about a hobby where they have mastery. Its your responsibility to get them to open up a bit.</p><h3><b>Go off script</b></h3><p>The really interesting aspects of the candidate will not be found in standard questions. Use them as a starting point, but follow up, ask for more details and let those answers lead you down another line of questioning. Take a clue from late night talk show hosts who have one or two prompt questions but are really there to listen rather than talk. Everyone is remarkable for some reason. Dont stop until you find out why.</p>"Resumes,When to Pop the Salary Question,"<div><h1>When to Pop the Salary Question</h1></div><div><p>One of the most potentially awkward aspects of interviewing job candidates is tackling the issue of salary. Candidates dread the negotiation process, but you can make it easier for both of you by following a few simple guidelines.</p></div><h3>When to talk about a salary</h3><div><p>The best time to negotiate a salary is at the end of the interview when you have a good idea of what the candidate can bring to the organization. You cannot responsibly manage a negotiation <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/11/jobs/how-to-play-your-hand-for-a-salary.html"">until you have formed an impression of what the candidate is worth</a>. Your first priority before talking about money should therefore be to assess the candidate's suitability for the role.</p></div><div><p>Candidates are also more likely to feel comfortable discussing salary at the end of the interview, once they have had the chance to find out more about the job's responsibilities. Before trying to pin down a figure, make sure you let the candidate know about the benefits they can enjoy while working for your company. These perks might include opportunities for training and career progression, as well as other employee benefits, such as childcare, healthcare, bonuses, stock options or employer-supported pension plans. Candidates are often willing to accept a slightly lower salary if they know that the company will treat them well.</p><h3>When to bring up salary early</h3></div><div>The exception to the rule of waiting to discuss salary is when you have a <a href=""http://partners.nytimes.com/library/jobmarket/072797sabra.html"">strict hiring budget</a> and need to check that a candidate's minimum salary requirement falls within the affordable range. In this case, it makes sense to ask the candidate to declare the minimum salary that they will accept before you spend time assessing their suitability for the job. Bringing up salary early in the interview allows both parties to find out early if their salary expectations are incompatible.</div><h3>How to negotiate a salary</h3><div><p>Talking about compensation with a prospective employee is a necessary part of the hiring process. Here are some tips for broaching the subject:</p></div><div><ul><li>You can begin to bring up the subject of employee compensation by discussing the candidate's salary history. You can do this while going over the work history presented on the resume with the candidate. This creates a reference figure that you can use to anchor the salary negotiation.<br></li></ul><div><ul><li>Try not to suggest an exact figure right away. Instead, ask the candidate about their salary expectations. Going through the <a href=""http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/04/14/when-should-you-discuss-your-salary-in-a-job-interview/"">process of negotiation</a> is an opportunity for interviewers to assess the negotiation skills of candidates and find out how they value their own skills.<br></li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Ask the candidate to justify their expected salary, especially if they are looking for a raise compared to their previous position. Are they going to be taking on a position of greater responsibility in your organization?</li></ul><ul><li>Ask the candidate to consider how other priorities, such as employee benefits and opportunities for career progression, stack up for them compared to salary.<br></li></ul></div></div><h3>Leading successful salary negotiations</h3><div><p>Many people find discussing money to be rather awkward, but a discussion about salary is unavoidable when hiring a new employee. Approach the subject professionally and with confidence by following the advice provided above.</p></div>"Career,How to Conduct a Behavioral Job Interview,"<h1>How to Conduct a Behavioral Job Interview</h1><p>Youve probably heard the term ""behavioral job interview,"" and you may wonder how to go about using this method. This type of interviewing requires candidates to share stories of how they handled challenges in past jobs, giving hiring managers an added insight during employee selection. In a nutshell, a <a href=""http://jobsearch.about.com/cs/interviews/a/behavioral.htm"">behavioral job interview</a> focuses on the actions and responses that individuals had in certain situations, which enables the interviewer to predict how the candidates may perform for them. </p> <h2><b>Whats Behind a Behavioral Job Interview? </b></h2> <p>Developed in the 1970s by industrial psychologists, behavioral interviews have become popular with some recruiters. The idea behind behavioral interviews is that past work performance can be a key indicator of future performance and cultural fit. Its not surprising that nearly one-third of all companies do some form of behavioral interview. How an individual responds in a given work scenario can provide clues as to their suitability for a role within your organization. </p> <h2><b>Tips for Conducting a Behavioral Job Interview</b></h2> <p>Learn how to conduct a behavioral interview with these helpful tips. </p> <p>1.<b>Determine the specific characteristics, work style and personality that will best meet the requirements of the position you are interviewing for.</b>Before you start drafting a list of behavioral interview questions, consider what you are looking for in the ""perfect"" candidate. </p> <p>2.<b>Create a job description that accurately describes the type of candidate you are seeking, with a few details of the possible scenarios.</b> By making sure that candidates have an inkling of what they can expect working for your organization in this role, you can design behavioral interview questions around realistic situations. </p> <p>3.<b>Know the candidates by reviewing resumes, profiles and pre-employment assessments to get to the foundation of each individual.</b> A <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-51052947/how-to-conduct-a-job-interview/"">CBS News</a> article advises that interviewers should ""have the information [needed] to get a sense of what each candidate is all aboutand what they might bring to the positionbefore you conduct the actual interview.""

They offer the opportunity to ask relevant questions and find out more about the candidates' strengths and weaknesses. As you know, depending on which position youre hiring, youll want to tailor your questions to find out more specific information about how a candidate will handle themselves in different situations. A well-thought-out<a href=""http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/how-to-save-customer-service/"">hiring process</a> is necessary in order to build the kind of customer service that will really help move your company forward.</p><h3>The Resumes</h3><p>For a customer service position, it obviously helps if the candidate has experience in customer service and even more so if they have experience in your industry. But don't limit yourself. The best candidate is likely found in a mix of<a href=""http://www.customerexperienceinsight.com/proven-ways-to-hire-customer-service-heroes/"">a broad range of people</a>. Sometimes the best customer service comes in unexpected places - people with service industry experience (working at hotels or restaurants) often have impeccable customer service skills.</p><p>Look for experience that might not be specific customer service positions but likely required patience and people skills. Find someone who has a track record of keeping their jobs for a decent amount of time. Job-hopping can be indicative of people with low patience levels.</p><p>After you've chosen a few candidates, it's time to conduct the interview. Here are four important questions to ask that will give you a sense of how well the candidate will perform in the job.</p> <p></p> <h3>What is customer service?</h3> <p>Start with the basics  ask the candidate to define customer service. This will give them a chance to describe what they think a customer service role should accomplish. Hopefully they know it requires them to be knowledgeable, helpful and treat customers with a friendly attitude in order to assist them. Try to glean whether or not they believe that good customer service can really set a business apart from its competitors. </p> <h3>What are your greatest strengths?</h3> <p>Here youll want to look for candidates who report that their greatest strengths are in dealing with people and problem solving. There are a lot of different personality types that can thrive in a customer service role, but you want to make sure your potential employee has qualities such as<a href=""http://customerservicepsychology.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/is-there-a-kind-of-person-who-will-always-be-better-at-customer-service/"">resilience, emotional intelligence and instinctive communication</a>. Listen to what qualities the candidate values about himself or herself.</p> <h3>How would you deal with an angry customer?</h3> <p>This is a chance to give a very specific example of a customer who might call in or write an angry complaint about your company or product to see how the candidate will respond. Youll want someone who knows to respond with courtesy and who might have some ideas about how to resolve the issue and be sure that it does not escalate. </p> <h3>Describe a situation where you successfully dealt with a customers needs</h3> <p>This will give the candidate an opportunity to convey their experiences and skills. You can look for candidates who have a proven track record of dealing with and resolving customer issues successfully. The example they provide should show how adept they are at reading situations and providing satisfying service.</p><p>Keep your interview for a customer service position on track with these questions, and look for candidates who have a relaxed and friendly attitude in order to ensure that you hire the best candidate for the job.</p>"Job Search Tips,Listening Tips for Interviewers,"<div><h1>Listening Tips for Interviewers</h1></div>A key skill for recruiters is listening carefully to what candidates say during a job interview. Although it might sound easy and obvious, listening is a skill that all of us can improve upon. Here are some listening tips for interviewers.<h3>Talk less, listen more</h3><div>It's the old 80/20 rule. As a general rule, the interviewer should speak about 20 percent of the total interview time. The remaining 80 percent should be devoted to listening to what the candidate has to say. The primary purpose of the interview is to find out more about the candidate in order to assess their suitability for the role. Interviewers should, therefore, resist the temptation to spend too much time trying to ""sell"" the position or the company to the candidate, as the best applicants will already have found most of the information they need through their own research.</div><h3>Understand why listening is difficult</h3><div>Listening seems like it should be easy, but many people actually find it very difficult to stay focused on a speaker for long periods of time. <a href=""http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=CM150"">Professor Ralph G. Nichols from the University of Minnesota</a> explained in his book ""Are You Listening?""<i> </i>that the human brain can comprehend speech must faster than the average person can talk. In fact, interpreting speech only takes up about 25 percent of our mental capacity. The result is that the mind starts to wander, causing distracting thoughts to creep in and demand attention.</div><h3>Learn to stay focused</h3><div>According to Professor Nichols, the trick to absorbing more information is to actively engage the brain in the listening process. Interviewers should mentally pick out key points from the candidate's responses to form mental summaries. Making notes on paper is also useful, particularly when interviewing many candidates in one day. The notes made during the interview should be brief so that the act of writing does not become a distraction from listening attentively. Written notes about each candidate can be fleshed out into useful summaries immediately after the interview.</div><h3>Give the candidate room to expand on their answers</h3><div><a href=""http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/best-interview-technique-you-never-use.html"">Management coach Rodger Dean Duncan </a>explains a technique he uses when interviewing candidates to get them to expand more on their answers. After listening to a candidate's response, he waits a full five seconds before asking his next question. This pause allows the candidate to add any other relevant thoughts and also gives the interviewer a chance to make a note of the key points of the candidate's response. Many people find silences awkward, but jumping in as soon as a candidate has finished speaking can prevent them from giving the thoughtful, detailed responses that are needed to assess their suitability for employment.</div><h3>Learning to listen better</h3><div>By fighting the urge to fill silences with the sound of their own voice, and by paying more attention to absorbing and summarizing what the candidate says, interviewers can get a more detailed picture of a candidate's suitability for a role. These listening tips can help interviewers make better informed decisions when hiring new employees.</div>"Interviews,10 First Questions for Job Interviews,"<p></p><h1>8 First Questions for Job Interviews</h1><p></p><p>Youre looking for the right candidate for an open position, and youve narrowed down the list of potential new employees. Now its time for the interview processthe hardest and most important part of filling a job.<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/business/economy/despite-job-vacancies-employers-shy-away-from-hiring.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" target=""_blank"">The New York Times</a>reports that in todays economy, employers think that the interview process is even more crucial than ever, and they are taking nearly twice as long as they did in 2010 to decide on candidates.</p><p>As you know, interviews allow employers to gain a first impression of a candidates personality as well as how they handle themselves in a room with other people. We suggest breaking the ice with one of these first interview questions.<br></p><h3><b>1. Did you have a nice weekend?</b></h3><p>Or a similar question like it. One of the<a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-51052952/the-7-interview-questions-you-must-ask/"" target=""_blank"">most tried and true ways</a>to begin an interview is to get the candidate relaxed and establish a rapport. By asking them a general question such as if they had a nice weekend  you make yourself seem friendly, and you can start feeling out their personality.</p><h3><b>2. Tell me about yourself</b></h3><p>This question is as much about how they choose to answer as it is about what they say. If they start listing their accomplishments, and those accomplishments are not relevant to the job, it's a missed opportunity on their part and possibly a sign that they dont understand the position or arent critical thinkers.</p><h3><b>3. What makes you stand out from others?</b></h3><p>This question is similar to the one before, but it<a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/business/en-us/resources/management/recruiting-staffing/hiring-6-interview-questions-you-need-to-ask.aspx?fbid=HzP8ffR7lw4"" target=""_blank"">hones in on</a>specifics relating to the candidate and the position. The correct answer, of course, is the one in which the candidate positions himself as a proper fit for your organization.</p><h3><b>4. Tell me why you're here</b></h3><p>Asking what brought a candidate to apply for the job can help you understand their motivations, and it can help you better understand what direction they are interested in heading in their career.</p><h3><b>5. What attracted you to the company?</b></h3><p>Finding out how much research a candidate has done about your company will give you insight into their motivation and their interest in your business and what you do. Finding a candidate who has an inherent curiosity and knowledge about your company is important.<br></p><h3><b>6. Why are you interested in this position?</b></h3><p>This question is a great way to see what the candidate actually knows about your company and this job. By asking them why they want the specific position, you can see if they have done the research and if they are really knowledgeable about the position.</p><h3><b>7. Why are you seeking a new job?</b></h3><p>This question will give you some insight into the candidate's current job situation. Are they leaving a job because they are interested in progressing their career, or are they leaving for another reason? You can gain some valuable information about a candidate from learning about their desire to leave their current job or change careers.<br></p><h3><b>8.What's the last book you read?</b></h3><p>This can be a nice introductory question because it not only serves as an ice breaker to loosen up the candidate, but it also gives them an opportunity to talk about their personal interests and reveal some of their personality traits. Is he or she excited about reading or do they not show much interest or curiosity in books? There's no right or wrong answer, but the way a candidate approaches the question can be telling.</p>"Job Search Tips,"Searching for a new Job?

Polish Your Online Presence <br></h2> <p>Before you turn in any applications, make sure your social media profiles will not ruin your chances.

A resume can't land you a position all on its own, but it can disqualify you from one very quickly. Avoid the following mistakes to keep your resume out of the rubbish bin.</p> <h3><b>1. Too long</b></h3><p>Resumes should be one to two pages. If you need a jumbo paper clip to keep all the pages together, it's time to shorten it, usually by limiting how far back your job history goes. <br></p> <h3><b>2. Forgetting to tailor</b></h3><p>Looking for jobs in a few different industries is common, but you don't need to advertise that to every hiring manager. The job history and objective you share for a management position in a warehouse should be different than the ones you include when you apply to run a restaurant. <br></p> <h3><b>3. Neglecting to update your resume</b></h3><p>Don't make the mistake of leaving an old phone number or address on the document, and be sure to add your most recent jobs or any new skills you've learned. Sounds obvious, but it happens.<br></p> <h3><b>4. Putting information in the wrong order</b></h3><p>Recent college graduates with limited work experience should put their education information at the top. When you've had solid work experience, flip the order and put your impressive work history first, with your most recent job at the top of the section. <br></p> <h3><b>5. Listing your references</b></h3><p>This is, unless requested, a waste of valuable space. Instead, write "" References available upon request,"" or even leave out the references section altogether if the document is long. <br></p> <h3><b>6. Hard to read</b></h3><p>Leave some white space on the page by using bullet points when possible, and make the font easy to read. Hiring managers don't want to squint at your resume, so make it easy to read. <br></p> <h3><b>7. Including personal information</b></h3><p>Unless they enhance your qualifications for a specific position, your ability to juggle, dance or recite the alphabet backward can be left off your resume.<br></p> <h3><b>8. Using an unprofessional email address</b></h3><p>If you made up your email handle when you were much younger, it probably isn't very professional. Using your name or a slight variation of it is your best bet. Save the more personalized and silly email addresses for conversing with your friends online. <br></p> <h3><b>9. Too vague</b></h3><p>Employers want to see what you did to improve the last company you worked for. Instead of claiming you helped the sales department, mention how you increased sales on hats by 25 percent, for example. Be sure to use action verbs in each bullet point. <br></p> <h3><b>10. Typos</b></h3><p>This is the easiest issue to fix, yet it is still one of the most common resume mistakes. Allowing typos to stick around sends the message that you can't write very well, don't notice details or simply don't care. None of these are appealing qualities in an applicant, so make sure you use the spell-check tool, proofread and then have your friends or relatives proofread your resume, too.</p>"Resumes,Best resume templates,"<h2>Best Free Resume Templates<br></h2><p>When you sit down to create the resume that's going to land you a great job, it's not always easy to decide on the best format.

Get ready!,"<h1><b>Top 10 Interview Questions to Prepare For</b><b></b></h1> <p>So youve found a great job prospect, sent in your cover letter and resume, and theyve called you in for an interview. Congratulations. Youre one major step closer to landing the job you want. Now comes the interview. It's OK to be nervous, but here's something that should reduce your jitters. Most interviewers ask variations of the same questions. If you do your homework, you'll know which questions will be asked before the interview, and you can practice answering them all. Check out our list of the top 10 interview questions, and rehearse an answer for each of these.</p> <p></p> <h3><b>1.</b><b>Tell me something about yourself</b></h3><p>This is one of the most popular first questions. Theres no right answer. This question is about both what you say and how you say it. Dont brag about all of your accomplishments here. Talk about your educational and career path honestly and relate them to the position for which you're applying.</p> <h3><b>2.</b><b>Whats your greatest weakness?</b></h3><p>This is another question potential employers ask to see how candidates will answer. Most people take it as an opportunity to brag about themselves (""I actually work too hard""). This seems disingenuous. Be honest with this one, but choose something that does not directly affect the job's responsibilities.</p> <h3><b>3.</b><b>Why did you leave your last job?</b></h3><p>Employers are always curious why you left one company and now want to come to theirs. Try to be positive, whether you had a negative experience or not. Its better to say that you wanted to move forward in your career path than ""I didnt get promoted for 10 years.""</p> <h3><b>4.</b><b>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</b> <b></b></h3><p>Whether or not you see yourself associated with the company, its important that they think you want to be there for the long term. Answer with something related to the company and the industry. Companies want to hire people with long-term interest who are willing to invest time and energy.</p> <h3><b>5.</b><b>What do you hope to be making, money-wise, at this job?</b></h3><p>This is a tough question, especially if it comes up too early. If your interviewer asks you, its best to offer a range. Do research before your interview about pay ranges for this job. Make it a number that you actually want to make. Salary is almost always negotiable, and it can be viewed as a detriment--as unprofessional--if you don't know how much someone in your field makes.</p> <h3><b>6.</b><b>What is your greatest achievement?</b></h3><p>Employers want to see someone with self-confidence. Choose something related to the job you're applying for, if possible. </p> <h3><b>7.</b><b>Why do you think you are suited for this particular position?</b></h3><p>Do some research before the interview about what the job entails, where it can lead to professionally and more about the company specifically. Answer with details about the company, industry, the position and where you and your skills fit into the mix.</p> <h3><b>8.</b><b>Whats the biggest challenge youve had to face in the workplace, and how did you overcome it?</b></h3><p>Your interviewer wants to find out whats a challenge for you, and what kind of approach you took to overcome it. They want to see that you are a good team player and that you have good problem-solving skills. Dont worry about the challenge making you look bad. Everyone has tough moments. Choose one that you overcame gracefully and is relevant to the position you're interviewing for.</p> <h3><b>9.</b><b>What do you like most about your current/most recent job?</b></h3><p>Be honest. Most likely there will be similar characteristics between your current job and the one you want. (Just dont say free donuts on Friday.) Make it something about the work or the office environment. The interviewer wants to make sure that you will be a good fit at the company and that you will feel happy there as well.</p> <h3><b>10. </b><b>Do you have any questions for me?</b></h3><p>This one always comes at the end of the interview. Whether you really do have questions or not, ask some. If you dont, it seems like youre not interested in the company or that you dont think quickly. </p> <p></p> <p>If you have a big interview coming up, go over these 10 interview questions, and then prepare your answers. If you already have them in your head before youre asked, you wont be put on the spot and youll seem calm, cool and collected throughout the process.</p>"Resumes,How to write a professional resume and cover letter,"<h1>How to Write a Professional Resume and Cover Letter</h1><p>First impressions are everything. This is always the case when applying for jobs. So it's important that your resume and cover letter look professional. Whether you're applying for your first job or dusting off your resume, these tips on how to create a professional resume and cover letter will help.</p><h3>Keep Your Personality in the Cover Letter</h3><div>Avoid template cover letters. Hiring managers dislike copy-and-pasted material. It saves you time, but it causes hiring managers' eyes to glaze over. A copy-and-paste job doesn't tell the recruiter anything about you--the actual you. Instead, use a template as just that--a template. Start with it, but give it your own personal twists. In general, refrain from telling jokes or morbidity in your cover letter. If you're a people person, that vibe should be apparent from reading your cover letter aloud. If you've done your homework and researched the company, that should be apparent in the cover letter.</div><h3>KISS</h3><p>Keep It Simple, Silly. Sure, it's a well-worn phrase, but there's a good reason. It works. Don't go overboard and write an essay. Think along the lines of a synopsis. Tell the hiring manager what they need to know, but leave just room for them to want to know more. This makes for a much better interview--and increases your chances of getting one. As a rule of thumb, your resume should not be more than two pages and your cover letter should be no longer than 400 words.</p><h3>Share Your Experiences</h3><div>List what you've learned and experienced as it's relevant to the position. Hiring managers are eager to know what you've learned and what you know so they can envision how you will help their company.</div><h3>Explain How Your Qualifications Can Help</h3><div>Tell the company you're applying to how your specific qualifications can help its business. For example: How is it that your five years of experience in customer service can help the hospital you're applying to attain better patient satisfaction? Think about the questions you might be asked you ahead of time and answer them cleverly in your cover letter and resume objective.</div><h3>Format Your Resume</h3><p>When listing each job description, use bullet points, but refrain from using them in your cover letter. Bullet points in a cover letter make it look less formal. But they help a resume stand out.</p><p>A sample resume or cover letter template can assist you with formatting and the placement of details. Also, remember to spell-check, read the finished resume, spell-check again and read the cover letter aloud. Include your contact details on both. Did we mention spell-check?</p>"Interviews,Top 10 interview tips from headhunters,"<h1>Top 10 Interview Tips from Headhunters</h1><p>Every interview is different. But there are standard questions and interview tips that come up during most interviews.We looked at advice from five different headhunters, including Sharon Hall and Kaye/Bassman, and we broke what they had to say down to these 10 interview tips, straight from the mouths of headhunters.</p><h3>10. Tell me about how you got into this industry</h3><p>Answers relating to the industry should focus on experiences that attracted you to this type of work. Attempt to identify similarities between the offered position and your experience.</p><h3>9. What are some previous conflicts you've had in past jobs?<br></h3><p>When being interviewed, you'll likely be asked questions to determine if you are a good fit for the company. There might be questions concerning personality conflicts designed to find out if you are difficult to deal with. You should be honest and straightforward without overemphasizing any one conflict. Instead, explain the positive things that came out of the conflict.</p><h3>8. What are your hobbies?</h3><p>Discuss interests such as music, sports and cultural activities. Talk about clubs and anything else that doesn't revolve around business. The point is to demonstrate that you are well-rounded. Businesses want people who leave work at work and regenerate their minds when they are not at work.</p><h3>7. What is one past success you're truly proud of?</h3><p>The manager is not looking for a definition of success but wants to know what specific things you have been successful at. You should focus on external factors that influenced your success when possible and emphasize your abilities only when others have commented on them.</p><h3>6. What are your strengths on the job?</h3><p>Cliches and general statements don't work here. Give specific examples of skills and how they apply to the open position. Don't mention anything generic. Be detailed.</p><h3>5. Tell us about your previous mistakes</h3><p>This is not a laundry list of things you have done wrong. The manager is looking for one single mistake or failed project that you have been involved in. Don't worry about perfection. The point is to identify your willingness to accept personal responsibility and whether or not a valuable lesson was learned.</p><h3>4. Have you ever disagreed with your supervisor?</h3><p>The correct answer is anything other than, ""I have never worked for anyone that I didn't get along with."" Everyone with experience has had disagreements with their supervisors. Applicants that say they get along with everyone either have an integrity issue or lack of experience in tough situations.</p><h3>3. What is your greatest weakness?</h3><p>You should always be prepared for this question because it will almost always be asked. You should have conducted enough self-examination to provide an honest answer along with an example of how you compensate for that weakness. It's OK to admit an actual weakness, as long as you also discuss how you've learned to compensate for it.<br></p><h3>2. Why are you leaving your current job?</h3><p>This is a big question for many managers. A resume that is filled with frequent job changes is a red flag that can indicate poor performance. Quality employees tend to stay in a position three to five years before moving to another position. The ability to adapt and survive through any circumstance is what makes a person a great employee. Explain why you are leaving your current job, and properly explain your job history.<br></p><h3>1. Why don't you tell me a little about yourself?</h3><p>While it may seem like an obvious question, it's one of the most important. Even though managers may still complete the interview, many times they will scratch an applicant off the list based solely on this question. This is your first impression, and it is an important one because you will not get a second chance. The manager is looking to see how articulate and confident you are along with where in your career you are. The secret to nailing this question is to focus on what's important to the manager.</p><p>While you can't plan for the unexpected, understanding what makes a great interview is a good place to start. Learning how to answer these questions and use interview tips can help you complete a successful interview.</p><p>One final bit of advice: practice, practice, practice.<br></p>"Interviews,How to prepare for your phone interview,"<h1><b>How to Prepare for Your Phone Interview</b></h1> <p>Phone interviews are becoming more common as employers seek to screen candidates before meeting them in person. If you've been selected for a phone interview, first, congratulate yourself. Your resume is getting results. But don't pop the bubbly yet. It's time to prepare for the call that could lead to your next job.</p><h3> Do Your Research </h3><p></p> <p>Hiring managers want to see that applicants are knowledgeable about the position and excited about it. That means you should check out the company's website to learn about its history, mission statement, departments and goals. Go over the job description again and write down any questions about it that you can ask during the interview. When you know important facts about the company and the position, it shows that you are interested and have done your homework. <br></p> <h3>Prepare Answers Ahead of Time </h3> <p>Just like the in-person version, your phone interview will consist of the interviewer asking questions and expecting descriptive, polished answers. You can prepare for this by rehearsing the answers to common questions. After all, the advantage of this type of interview is that you can refer to your notes at will, so it makes sense to outline good answers to common questions, which might include the following: <br></p><ul><li>What are your weaknesses?</li><li>What are your strengths?</li><li>What are your career goals?</li><li>What's an average day at work like for you?</li><li>Why do you want this job?</li><li>Why do you want to leave your current job? <br></li></ul> <p>Know what you'll say in answer to questions about salary history, willingness to travel and the soonest you could start the job.</p><p>In addition, write down a few questions to ask at the end of the phone interview. <br></p> <h3>Plan Out the Practical Details </h3> <p>Double-check the date and time of the interview to ensure it's correct.</p><p>Make sure you have a quiet area in your house where you can sit comfortably and talk on the phone or when you can walk around, if you think better on your feet.</p><p>Keep the computer on in case you have to look something up or send and receive email during the interview. If you're using a cell phone, make sure it's fully charged.<br></p> <h3>Treat It Like You Would a Traditional Interview </h3> <p>People fail the typical phone interview because they don't take it seriously. If you are worried about falling into that trap and treating it too casually, consider dressing professionally for the phone interview, just as you would if you were meeting in person.</p><p>And don't forget to smile during the conversation. Even though the interviewer can't see your face, the tone of your voice will convey your positivity, and that's always more appealing than a boring or negative tone. <br></p> <p>Once you ace your phone interview, remember to send a thank you note to the person who conducted it.</p><p>Then continue applying for jobs listed on <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a> while you wait to find out if you merited an in-person interview.</p>"Career,How to plan your career path,"<h1>How to Plan Your Career Path</h1><div>These days it pays to plan your career path.

Finding a job and networking suddenly become imperative. If you're a college student or a new college grad who is still choosing a career, we'd like to turn yourattention to opportunities in these high-growth markets. Based on research completed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, here are five of the fastest-growing careers available to new graduates.<br></p><h3>5. Nursing</h3><p>Nursing tends to find a spot on ""top jobs"" lists every year. The reason? Its an in-demand position that requires extensive training and dedication. Many people lack the fortitude to complete nursing school and go on to help patients in real-world situations. It takes a special type of person to study and succeed in this field, so the supply of workers is narrow.</p><p>National demographics have heightened the need. There are an increasing number of people who need medical care. Baby boomers are reaching the age where they require medical care in order to remain active and healthy. As doctors and hospitals become busier with the needs of baby boomers, and boomers retire and slow down, the demand for qualified nurses grows.</p><h3>4. Financial Adviser</h3><p>Markets continue to decline and businesses are increasingly regulated, so companies and individuals are turning to financial advisers to help plan and control their financial investments and budgets. Some financial advisers specialize in corporate finances while others offer personal services. Regardless of the emphasis, financial advisers are becoming more common in the realms of corporate and personal finance.<br></p><h3>3. Public Relations</h3><p>PR is one of the fastest growing industries in the market today. Why?Social media.Social media has become powerful as companies are able to communicate with customers directly. As a result, PR is more important than ever. PR disasters are all-too-common on social media, and companies need proswhocan represent their brand and put out fires before they spread. As the number of social media channels and their importance increases, so will demand for people who understand social media and have PR skills.<br></p><h3>2. Marketing Consultant</h3><p>As with public relations, social media and the Internet have changed the game for marketers. There is a growing demand for marketing pros who understand how to thrive in cyberspace. This is because many traditional marketing tactics do not work online. As customers go mobile with their attention, companies must adapt or risk losing business.</p><p>Because this industry is new and potentially lucrative, competition is fierce. Small, adaptive marketing firms often compete better than their well-established, larger, off-line counterparts. These small companies are becoming the go-to marketing firms for many of the worlds leading businesses, and as they grow so do their personnel needs.</p><h3>1. Accountant</h3><p>Most of the jobs on this list are related to business and finance. As markets change and economic uncertainty persists, businesses and individuals are turning to specialists to manage their money. Because of this, and because of increasingly complicated tax and healthcare laws, accountants are almost always at the top of these lists. No shock theyre No. 1 again.</p><p>Based on current job trends, the safe bet for new college grads is to aim for careers in healthcare and business solutions. Some of these fields require additional training, but each potentially provides a stable and financially rewarding career for those who pursue them.</p>"Resumes,Top 10 tips for recruiting techniques,"<h1><b>Top 10 Recruiting Tips</b></h1><p>Finding the right candidate to fill a job can be a challenge, but with a good strategy you can get the right hire and save the company time and money. Follow these 10 recruiting tips to get qualified candidates into jobs faster.</p><p><h3><b>Plan Ahead</b></h3>Always think of the recruitment process as a project. Have an exact step-by-step plan in place. Large companies have these processes in place, but small- and medium-sized companies often operate on the fly, which can be time-consuming.</p><p><h3><b>Define the Role</b></h3>Have a clear idea of what the company needs. Analyze the position to determine the requisite skills. Know which skills are essential for the first day and which can be learned. You should also consider behavior, personality and the type of person who will thrive and function best at your company.</p><p><h3><b>Plan Even More</b></h3>Have a backup plan for filling your job funnel in case your initial strategy does not work.<b></b>If you or your coworkers lack knowledge or experience in a certain field, work with an agency that has hired in that field before.</p><p><h3><b>Think Outside the Norm</b></h3>To unearth top candidates, think beyondbiographical interviews and resumes. For example, you might consider <a href=""http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.acpm.org/resource/resmgr/careers-files/behav_interview.pdf"">behavioral profiling</a>. Yes, it sounds like--and is--something police do. But recruiters do it, too. If you're hiring for an industry that has its own unique sets of challenges and demands, a certain behavioral type can be beneficial in a candidate.</p><p><h3><b>Stick to the Timeline</b></h3>Your plan should have hard dates. You will need to stick to them, or the company's production will suffer, and you could miss out on the right candidate.</p><p><h3><b>Follow the Rules</b></h3>It almost goes without saying, but we will say it anyway: Study state and federal law in order to conduct interviews fairly and avoid lawsuits.</p><p><h3><b>Organize Your Funnel</b></h3>When you advertise available positions, applications will flow in, sometimes rapidly. It can be hard to keep tabs on which candidates you like and which you have ruled out. Put a system in place to track them so none slip through the cracks.</p><p><h3><b>Really Get to Know Them</b></h3>In the final stages of recruitment, try to get to know them better. Consider taking candidates to lunch with one or two of their potential coworkers to see how they interact in a less formal setting.</p><p><h3><b>Be Ready</b></h3>When you're selecting your final candidate, have a properly planned introductory process in place. If all the necessary arrangements are not made, it can be stressful for potential new hires. Many a new employee has quit on the first day.</p><p><h3><b>Revise, Revise, Revise</b></h3>Re-visit your recruitment process regularly. Ask if there are things you can do to improve the hiring process. Make necessary changes. Your future-you will thank you.</p><p></p>"Interviews,Top 10 online recruitment strategies,"<h2>Top 10 Online Recruitment Strategies</h2><p>Building an effective team is a challenging task for any business. How do you recruit the best people and convince them to stay? You need a plan. And a necessary part of any good recruitment plan is an online recruitment strategy. It's not just enough to post the position on the company website, share a link on Facebook and hope for the best. Your company needs a multi-pronged online strategy that will net you the highest level of job seekers.</p><p>Next time you hire, consider these 10 online recruitment strategies.</p><h3>10. Virtual Job Fairs</h3><p>A current trend at universities is to create a continual virtual job fair. It works much like a traditional job fair, but it's online and doesn't have an established end date. Companies register and update their job offerings through the fair's web portal. Many of these fairs are industry-specific.</p><h3>9. Mobile Advertising</h3><p>Mobile use is on the rise and so is mobile advertising. Think of these as mobile classified ads, only without the boring black-and-white newspaper ad structure. Mobile advertising is quickly becoming to the go-to medium for many businesses. It goes where the young workers are.</p><h3>8. Mobile Job Apps</h3><p>These are job boards without the standard bulletin board format. Instead of logging in to see a list of jobs that have been posted recently, these apps work more like Twitter and broadcast job announcements in real-time directly to the prospect's mobile device.</p><h3>7. 'Career Training' Website</h3><p>This one might sound odd, but it works. Leverage the power of affiliate marketers to find high-quality prospects. Here's how it works. A popular strategy for affiliate marketers is to build an authority site that can dominate search results for the target keyword. A popular topic for these sites is ""career training."" The developers of these sites have mastered SEO and are dominating search engine results for online recruitment related keywords. Partner with a site that targets your labor market and utilize these sites as search-friendly job boards.</p><h3>6. Search Engine Optimization<br></h3><p>Search engine optimization should be a part of any online recruitment campaign. Many people don't know the names of the job boards and virtual fairs, so they type a job title or other related keyword into a search engine. If you have postings on job boards, at virtual fairs or on your own website, you want prospects to find them in their search results. Include the keywords you think they will be searching for in the headline and copy.</p><h3>5. Social Media</h3><p>There are two different types of social media platforms that you can use. General networks such as Facebook and Twitter can help build awareness and shotgun opportunities to the masses. Targeted networks such as Linkedin can refine your search for quality prospects.</p><h3>4. Job Search Engines</h3><p>Job search engines such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>are popular among recent college graduates and experienced employees looking to advance their careers. These websites aggregate jobs from a host of websites, saving the searcher the time and trouble of searching on multiple sites. They also send alerts to job seekers when new jobs are available and allow them to post resumes that employers can search. Most importantly, employers can post jobs on the search engine itself.</p><h3>3. Job Boards</h3><p>The best boards usually have some form of obstacle such as resume requirements or a membership fee that weeds out those who aren't serious about searching for a job. This makes it easier to target quality prospects because those who remain are serious about their job search.</p><h3>2. Email Marketing</h3><p>Traditional email marketing has been a favorite for online marketers since the early 1990s. It is now being used by savvy recruiters to build relationships with prospective employees. One example: Create an e-newsletter for the employees in your industry. Make the information useful for every employee in the industry regardless of who they work for. Include a section for job openings. This strategy is proving to be surprisingly powerful.</p><h3>1. The Company Website</h3><p>Your company website should have an entire section dedicated to prospective employees. It should list all of the positions currently available and how to apply to them. In addition to explaining the financial benefits of working for your company, communicate the value your company can provide to their careers. Make this information easy to find and streamline the online application process. Before you can tackle social media, job search engines and job boards, you need to get your company website in order.</p>"Job Search Tips,Best job posting sites,"<h1>Best Job Posting Sites</h1><p>It's true.

Job seekers are allowed to upload several resumes to target several markets at once. Monster users can also review company profiles and salary information.</p><h3>TweetMyJobs</h3><p><a href=""http://www.tweetmyjobs.com/"">TweetMyJobs</a> is one of the new kids on the block, but it has built an impressive user base rather quickly. Instead of using the traditional board format, this service uses Twitter feeds to broadcast new job openings, which helps attract recent college grads and mobile users.</p><h3>Indeed</h3><p><a href=""http://www.indeed.com/"">Indeed</a> allows job seekers to search through a large database of available jobs and apply from its website.

Your next move should be to check out this list of online resources below. No, it's not comprehensive. It's an outline. Consider it a starting point as you plan for where to post a job. </p> <h3><b>College or Graduate School Career Resources Websites</b></h3><p>If you have an entry-level position opening up, or if you want to make sure you hire someone with a certain level of education, try college career resources websites. The process of getting your job listed on a school's website varies from school to school. Heads up: You might need to get in touch with each career resources department directly. For example, if you want to post your job at New York University, you must register online with theNYU Wasserman Center for Career Development and submit your opening for approval. Once the staff has reviewed your submission, they will release it to the student body. You also can speak with staff directly about listing your job by contacting them via telephone. On the phone, they can guide you through the process of how to list your job.</p><h3><b>Job Search Engine</b></h3><p>One of the most efficient places to post a job opening is on a job search engine such as<a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>.

Not only are they your opportunity to sit down and spend some time with someone who wants to work for your organization, they're a chance to ask thoughtful and interesting questions that help you both learn more about each other. By asking the right questions, you can learn much about a candidate's background, skills, ambitions and personality. Here is a list of 10 effective interview questions to ask candidates and why you should ask them.</p> <p></p> <h3>1.What are the first three things you would do if hired for this job?</h3> <p>This question gives the candidate a chance to demonstrate knowledge about the company and its goals while displaying initiative and strategic thinking.</p> <h3>2.Whats a real problem you could see occurring in this job, and how would you address it?</h3> <p>Youre looking for employees who will constantly be looking for ways to improve your operations and keep your company moving forward. The best ones will have given some thought to what their role in the company would be. Even if their answer is off-track, you can tell whether its something they have considered, and thats whats important.</p> <h3>3.How do you see this position growing over time within the company?</h3> <p>This gives the candidate an opportunity to show whether or not they are forward-thinking, i.e. budding thought leaders. You might want a candidate who is is interested on excelling and moving up. Most employers do.</p> <h3>4.Whats the biggest problem you see in this industry?</h3> <p>This is a great way to tap into the candidates knowledge of the business. Its a plus when someone does intensive research on your company, and if they can fit that into the big picture of your industry? Score.</p> <h3>5.What do you think are the most important skills for being successful in this job?</h3> <p>Here you can gain some insight into a candidates expectations of your culture and their own particular style to see whether or not they would make a good fit. </p> <h3>6.Can you think of a time at work when you felt very proud of an accomplishment?</h3> <p>This is a good question because it gives the candidate a chance to brag. You want a confident employee who takes pride in his or her work and loves to share stories of their success. Be wary of the candidate who seems sheepish answering this question. This person might represent your company someday.</p> <h3>7.What do you want from your career in the long term?</h3> <p>The answer should display forward thinking and ambition. Youre looking for someone who has clear goals and sees themselves continuing to grow.</p> <h3>8.What would be a deal-breaker for this job?</h3> <p>This gives the candidate a chance to honestly reveal things they dont like about a work environment or work relationships. A good candidate should have a clear idea of what these are as well as ideas about how to avoid encountering them in the future.</p> <h3>9.Talk about a time you took a risk and failed.</h3> <p>This shows that a candidate is not afraid to take risks in spite of the potential for failure. You can gauge whether or not they have a reckless attitude or take smart risks.</p> <h3>10. Is there anything you wish we had asked you about during this interview?</h3> <p>Turn the question asking around and give them a chance to offer information that you havent asked. This will give you insight into their character and the ways they are thinking about the job. You'll also discover more about their desire to impress you.</p><p>Finding a candidate with a fantastic resume is a huge part of making sure you are hiring the right person, but having a great list of interview questions to ask candidates helps ensure that your organization and your new employee will make a great fit.</p>"Job Search Tips,Most popular interview questions for employers,"<h1>6 Popular Interview Questions for Employers</h1><p></p><p>Choosing the right questions to ask potential employees is important. As you know, an interview offers a chance to see how candidates act under pressure as well as how quickly they can respond to unanticipated questions. By choosing your questions carefully, you can get a sense of which employees will be a good fit for both the position and the company. Here are six of the most popular interview questions asked by employers. These questions are asked often because they get results.</p><p></p><h3><b>1. What do you know about our company and the job you are seeking?</b></h3><p>This is a good first question to ask because it tells you exactly how much research and preparation the candidate did before the interview. The answers you receive will separate those who really know and care about your company from those who dont.</p><p></p><h3><b>2. Tell me about yourself</b></h3><p>This is one of the most popular interview questions and for good reason. Most job seekers will give you a long chronological summary of their accomplishments. What you want are candidates who highlight their best skills and relate them to how they will benefit the company. </p><h3><b>3. What are your short-term/long-term plans?</b></h3><p>Ask potential employees this question to get an idea of their ambitions and career goals. You will likely get some candidates who really havent given their futures much thought at all. Look for those who have a clear idea of which direction they are going and how they intend to get there.</p><p></p><h3><b>4. What are your strengths/weaknesses?</b></h3><p>These are classic questions, but they are well worth asking because they reveal something about potential employees. Strengths are pretty straightforward. Ideally, their strengths align with your needs, and they know that. The weakness question stumps a lot of people. Many candidates will spin the question with a positive answer such as ""I am a perfectionist."" Look for people who are thoughtful enough to come up with an answer that sounds sincere. These are the employees who know their capabilities and limitations.</p><p></p><h3><b>5. What are your salary requirements?</b></h3><p>This is a tricky question and one that causes significant stress for potential employees. If they respond with a very low figure, it shows they might not know their industry well. Asking this question is also a chance to see their negotiating skills. A good negotiator will respond by carefully circumventing and getting the employer to pitch the first figure. Many candidates think they need to answer this question, but the reality is that few employers will reject someone immediately just because they have high or low salary requirements.</p><h3><b>6. Do you have any questions?</b></h3><p>This is a good question to finish up with because it differentiates those who are simply looking for any job at all with those who want to make sure they will be a good fit. Great employees value their time and have a good idea of where they want to go in their careers. You can spot them because they are the ones who ask the most thoughtful questions.</p><p><a></a>While you will not be able to choose the perfect employee 100 percent of the time, asking these interview questions will help you find good fits for your company.</p>"Job Search Tips,Best job search engine,"<h1>Best job search engine</h1><p><a></a>Thousands of new jobs are created each month at companies large and small. Some are filled by recruiters, some through networking and some through direct applications. For many companies, job search boards are the most effective tools for finding new applicants.</p><p>OK, great, that's convenient for the companies doing he hiring. But if you're a job seeker, scrolling through all of those boards can be time-consuming.</p><p>This is where a job search engine comes in.</p><p>A job search engine is like a Google for jobs. But instead of crawling the Web for, say, cat videos, a job search engine crawls job boards and other websites for current job listings. The result is a continuously-updated aggregation of existing jobs.</p><p>The ability to save time and paint a more complete picture of job availability makes job search engines an important resource for job seekers.</p><h3>Why You Need a Job Search Engine</h3><p>The biggest challenge in the hiring process for both employers and job seekers is discovery. Employers want the best talent they can afford; job seekers want jobs befitting their skills and experience. Bringing these two parties together can be a difficult ask, especially if they're not on the same platform.</p><p>Job search engines are discovery tools that solve this problem. They empower job seekers by giving them the ability to search through job listings. They also give employers access to people with talent, skills and experience. This is a win-win.</p><p>The reasons you should use a job search engine include:</p><ul><li><b>Success: </b>Nearly 25 percent of external hires in 2010 were made through publicly searchable listings on job boards.</li><li><b>Aggregated Results: </b>Job search engines aggregate the open listings from many job boards in one easy-to-search platform, making job hunting easier.</li><li><b>Advanced Filters: </b>You have a better chance of landing the right job if you apply for relevant positions that require your talent, skills and experience. Instead of browsing through thousands of listings at a dozen job boards, you can use the advanced filtering capabilities of job search engines and find jobs that fit.</li><li><b>Employers Can Find You:</b> Instead of waiting for applications, employers often use job search engines to find candidates. You can upload your keyword-rich resume to these search engines.</li><li><b>Speed and Ease of Use:</b> Searching and applying for positions takes time that could be spent networking and polishing skills.</li><li><b>One-Click Applications: </b>Some search engines such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>have features such as SimplyApply, which make it possible for candidates to apply for dozens of jobs with a single click. This is a time-saver, especially if you're applying through a mobile device.</li></ul><p>Now that you know why you should use a job search engine, let's learn how you can make your resume pop.</p><h3>How to Make Your Resume Stand Out</h3><p>Following these rules will help:</p><ul><li><b>Use Keyword-Rich Resumes: </b>Many recruiters search for candidates by typing relevant keywords into search engines. These keywords usually pertain to a specific industry or role (for example: ""java"", ""c++"", ""objective C"", etc. for a coding position). By including industry-relevant keywords in your profile, you can increase your chances of being found.</li><li><b>Mind the Formatting: </b>Many Human Resources departments are still old-fashioned. That means that your resume likely will be printed on a sheet of paper and passed around the office. A poorly-formatted, illegible resume can hurt your chances.</li><li><b>Keep it Short:</b> A resume should be a highlight of your achievements and experience, not a complete recap of your life. Try to limit it to one page. Human resources departments will thank you for it.</li><li><b>Link to a Portfolio:</b> Job seekers in the creative and technology fields can increase their chances of getting hired by including a professional portfolio. This can be a link to a blog, website, or an online image gallery. Include it in a prominent place in the resume, preferably after the ""Experience"" section. Links are preferred over large file attachments.</li></ul><h3>The Best Job Search Engine</h3><p></p><p>Which job search engine is the best? Yes, we're biased, but we believe that<a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>, with its depth and diversity of job listings, is the best job search engine around. Make it the first place you upload your resume and start your search.</p>"Career,5 Things to Include in Every Job Posting,"<h1>5 Things to Include in Every Job Posting</h1><p></p><p>Write a good job posting and the resumes pour in. Which is both a good thing and a bad thing, right? You can avoid wading through piles of mismatched candidates by including the right information in your job postings. Follow these tips to attract the best people for the job while dealing with fewer candidates who lack skills or experience.</p><p></p><h3>A generally specific job title</h3><p></p><p>If you're too specific, the title can make a job seem more intensive than it is, scaring away candidates who can fill the position. A title that's too general may be unclear. Study the industry and consider job titles carefully. </p><p></p><p>To make a very obvious example: ""Dental Assistant"" is more appropriate than either ""Assistant"" or ""Assistant with Medical Knowledge for Dental Practice."" People who want to work in a dental office are searching for the first title, while the second and third titles might attract the wrong people or ward off the right ones.</p><p></p><h3>Daily expectations</h3><p></p><p>What does the organization need from this person from day to day? What tasks will they need to handle for the company to succeed? Open your job description with these expectations. For instance: ""Prep patients for dental care and perform minor tasks, like teeth cleaning."" Let candidates know exactly what they'll be expected to do on the job so neither party wastes time or money in pursuit of a job that is not a good match. </p><p></p><h3>The importance of the position</h3><p></p><p>Get the right people excited about coming to work for you by explaining how valuable they will be to your organization. This is also a good way to introduce the characteristics you're looking for in an employee. Show them why an employee will need certain commendable, admirable skills by including wording such as, ""We're looking for a kind and compassionate dental assistant who can help manage patients' stress during treatment, as well as pick up minor tasks without supervision."" </p><p></p><h3>Responsibilities and requirements</h3><p></p><p>Each job usually has three to five major responsibilities, all of which involve many tasks. Focus on at least the three most important responsibilities. If you try to include everything, your post will be messy and confusing. List responsibilities in order of importance, and if there's any necessary experience, education or credentials that are absolutely required, don't be afraid to list them in all caps to draw attention. </p><p></p><h3>Application instructions</h3><p></p><p>It's easy to get upset when applicants call when they're supposed to stop in or stop in when they're supposed to apply online. It wastes your time and leaves a bad impression of a candidate who otherwise might be an excellent choice. Your goal in creating a job listing is to draw the right person to your company. It sounds simple, but sometimes employers forget this important rule:Don't run away good applicants by forgetting to include in job postings the instructions necessary to apply for the job.If you can, direct them to a page on your business website that thanks them for their time and explains how to apply for the position.</p><p><a></a></p>"Resumes,Write a Job Posting That Grabs People's Attention,"<h1>Write a Job Posting That Grabs People's Attention</h1> <p>You want your job posting to grab the attention of the right candidates. How do you do that? Above all, and this may seem contradictory, but it's not: be conversational and professional. You want the right candidates to respect and trust that you'll be professional, which means writing a clean, professional job posting. You also don't want them to think your workplace is just another place to work. Your first contact with them sets the tone.</p><p>Here are a few tips for writing a great job posting:</p> <h3>A Simple, Straightforward Title</h3> <p>The difference between a good job listing and a great one can often be seen in the first line. When writing a job description title, think of other businesses advertising for the same kind of work. Does your industry have a standard way of describing the job? If so, stick to it. That's what people will be searching for. Besides, when you get too technical, <a href=""http://jobs.citi.com/orlando/onemain-financial/jobid4135027-onemain-financial-consumer-lending-sales-representative-orlando-fl-jobs?apstr=%26src%3DJB-14023"">as with this ad</a>, or when you're too vague, it leaves people in doubt.</p> <p>Identify the main responsibilities for the position first and then fortify them with a word or two, <a href=""http://www.getvideofilmeditingjobs.com/after-effects-editor-orlando-florida-38678791.htm?utm_source=SimplyHired&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=SimplyHired"">as seen here</a>. ""Groomer"" could become ""Dog Groomer."" ""Tutor"" could become ""Math and Science Tutor,"" and so on. ""Dog and Cat Groomer to Work with Veterinarian,"" on the other hand may leave people wondering if they need certain licensing or skills, or if they'll be providing other kinds of care for pets. It turns potential candidates away by including too much information.</p> <h2>Introduce Main Duties First</h2> <p>Hiring managers sometimes make the mistake of first listing the personality characteristics<a href=""http://www.ziprecruiter.com/job/Sales-Representative-copy-92/e3a69140/?source=cpc-simplyhired""></a> they're looking for. ""We want a charming, go-getter who excels at teamwork."" It's not just pat verbiage, it tells you very little about the position. Start with verbs that describe major tasks, such as ""Bathe and trim small to extra-large dogs at McFarland's Clinic."" <br></p> <p>Cover three to five duties your would-be employee will be expected to do most often. There's no reason to include every single task in the description, but you should mention tasks that might be a deal breaker, like periodic travel or night hours.</p> <h2>Make Your Requirements Stand Out</h2> <p>Anything that is absolutely necessary should be visible, either in bold, in bullet-point form or in all capital letters. It helps draw attention and lets applicants know these issues aren't just suggestions. ""GROOMER LICENSE REQUIRED."" It saves everyone time. Remember, job applicants have limited hours to use for job searching. They don't want to invest that time in opportunities that have no chance of panning out.</p> <h2>Discuss Tangible and Intangible Benefits</h2> <p>People love working at different companies for very specific reasons. A beefed up benefits plan can keep people feeling good through the roughest of conditions. A relaxing spot for taking breaks can add to the fulfillment someone gets from their job. Don't forget to mention these benefits to potential hires (this<a href=""https://teletech.taleo.net/careersection/5/jobdetail.ftl?lang=en&job=666959&src=JB-13422"">ad does an excellent job of highlighting both tangible and intangible rewards of working for this business)</a>.<br></p><p>Providing a wide range of benefits can mean the difference between getting the best and the brightest to come through your doors and getting stuck with candidates no one else wanted.</p> <h2>End with Instructions and Thanks</h2> <p>The way you close your listing can add to a candidate's impression. To further incite them to apply, thank them for reading, and invite them to apply. Follow this with easy instructions on how to do so.</p>"Interviews,Men: Interview Dress Tips That Never Go out of Style,"<p></p><h2>Men: Interview Dress Tips That Never Go out of Style</h2><p>The biggest problem with interview attire today is the rise of casual workplace settings and the numbers of candidates who dress to match them. Interviews are still a place where showing respect is key. Suits are preferred by most companies, even those where the CEO wears T-shirts and jeans. In order to avoid getting caught in these and other interview faux pas, pay attention to the following tips before you get dressed for your next job interview.</p><p></p><h3>Shirt, tie and shoes to match</h3><p></p><p>Some men show up to entry-level interviews dressed to the nines. They go overboard, knowing they'll never be asked to wear a tie or three-piece suit if they land the position. Then they screw it all up by putting on a pair of ragged sneakers or scuffed up shoes. </p><p></p><p>The details count. Leave your hipster pants at home and give yourself a chance at getting hired before letting the company know ""who you really are."" This isn't a speed date;it's a job interview. There will be plenty of time to let your personality shine once you're hired.</p><p></p><p>Sticking to the time-honored traditions of landing a job, show up to an interview looking like you're applying to run the place. The adage ""dress for success"" is taken seriously by hiring managers who make decisions based on certain appearance-related assumptions. <a href=""http://mashable.com/2013/02/10/job-interview-attire/"">Namely, experts say, someone poorly dressed at an interview doesn't have the business sense to do well on the job.</a></p><p></p><p>Select clothing for one step above what you would expect to wear to work every day, making the minimal choice business causal. For men who aren't fashion-conscious enough to know the difference, that means khakis and dress shirts. Even then, bring along a blazer just in case.</p><p></p><p>If you'll be working in an office, aim for a suit and tie. Executive positions mean pulling out all the stops. No tails are required, but you'll want to show up looking as tailored as possible. </p><p></p><h3>Scents and accessories</h3><p></p><p>It's easy for the small details to intimidate you when preparing for an interview. Many men don't understand what accessories to wear or leave at home, and they aren't sure what the rules are on cologne. Are you expected to wear it? Should you avoid it? On your big day, there are four things every man should be, according to professional career counselor<a href=""http://mashable.com/2013/02/10/job-interview-attire/"">Gaye Weintraub</a>: </p><p></p><ul><li>Well-groomed</li><li>Well-dressed</li><li>Smelling nice</li><li>Smiling</li></ul><p></p><p>That doesn't mean you drench yourself in scent. To smell nice, bathe using soap, brush your teeth and apply antiperspirant or deodorant. Take a refresher kit with you in case you start to sweat or wind up having something to eat or drink. It's best to leave fragrances for your first day of work.</p><p></p><p>Make sure you are well-groomed so that your appearance looks tidy. That means shaving. Shaving makes you look more serious. It can also make you appear youngereven trimmed beards can give the wrong impression. <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1100369"">As one pro put it, ""Too lazy to shave = too lazy to work.""</a></p><p></p><p>Along with being dressed in business or business casual attire, make your accessories match your look. For men, this usually limits you to a simple, stylish watch, clean business dress shoes or loafers and a wedding ring, if you have one. Surprisingly, scuffed shoes are one of the leading faux pas men make with their wardrobe. Don't make that mistake.

Depending on where you are hired, you might have a casual dress code. That said, you should never show up to an interview in casual clothing. This includes wearing battered or strangely colored tennis shoes along with a suit or pairing flip-flops with a summer dress. Accessories count and can seriously put a smudge on your interview outfit.</p><p></p><p>""Business casual"" is what you see in work sections of Banana Republic, Eddie Bauer and the like. Choose pieces like knee-length dresses, lightweight pants paired with T-shirts or blouses covered with a sweater or jacket and other somewhat formal outfits you might wear to graduation parties or regular religious services. Again, you should never wear tennis shoes or sandals to interviews, and pantyhose when wearing skirts are a must. In addition, tops shouldn't be sleeveless, too tight or show your cleavage.</p><p></p><p>""Business"" attire calls for a suit. Look for examples at Ann Taylor, Nordstrom or Brooks Brothers. You can wear a dress suit if you wish, but it shouldn't be any shorter than your knee. Likewise, you can pair a dark skirt with a blazer or business jacket. Stick to low-heeled shoes or pumps and jewelry that doesn't cause a distraction. </p><p></p><h2>Do your research</h2><p></p><p>Industries and even individual companies have their own dress codes. It's important to know what you'll be expected to wear every day before heading off to your interview. Dress a step up in formality, with business casual being your least formal option. You should never show up to an interview in anything less, even if you'll be working in fields all day.</p><p></p><p>The number one mistake candidates make in this area is dressing to match their position at a casual business employer. Showing up like you already have the job comes across as arrogance. This is as true for adding extra casual elementssuch as flamboyant hair accessoriesto a formal interview outfit. Show off your style after you're hired. During the interview, come across as someone with enough sense to show respect to your potential new boss.</p><p></p><h2>Avoid common problems</h2><p></p><p>Employment coaches have identified a number of faux pas women make on a consistent basis. Some of them reflect the fashion or attitude of the times, while others are simply mistakes that arise from nerves. Be sure to check yourself for these issues before stepping out the door:</p><p></p><ul><li>Showing cleavage or leg above the knee</li><li>Wearing too much makeup or perfume</li><li>Distracting nails or jewelry</li><li>Last minute spills</li></ul><p></p><p><a href=""http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/06/20/its-hot-outside-what-to-wear-to-interview/"">Experts recommend waiting until the last possible minute to put on a blazer or jacket in order to give off that crisp, fresh look.</a> Also, because there are hundreds of horror stories about last minute stains, it's recommended that you have a backup outfit in your car and ready to go. </p><p></p><p>First impressions count, so take advantage of these handy women's interview dress tips.

Sometimes youll live with a host family that can help acclimate you to the unfamiliar culture and environment. If youre involved in a teaching program, like those at <a href=""http://www.interexchange.org/working-abroad/teaching-program/teach-english-abroad"">InterExchange</a>, youll want to find out the specific requirements for living with a host family, such as any necessary immunizations, restrictions for personal belongings and specific rules or instructions, as well as addressing any dietary needs or allergies, if applicable.<br><br><h3><b>Knowledge and research</b></h3>Its a good idea to research the country in which you wish to teach English, says<a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2010/11/22/how-to-find-a-job-abroad"">Michael Morella of the U.S. News On Career</a> blog. Accumulate as much knowledge as you can about particular customs, holidays and traditions. Also, knowing the cost of living (if you arent living with a host family) and things like health care availability, money exchange rates and rules and laws for foreigners will help ease the transition once you do finally get a job teaching English overseas.<br><br><h3><b>Passports and work visas</b></h3>You'll need a passport if you want to visit and work in other countries, and in most cases you'll need a work visa. Work visas can be obtained through the embassy of the country you are traveling to. In most countries in Europe, <a href=""https://www.experience.com/alumnus/article?channel_id=Ventures_Abroad&source_page=additional_articles&article_id=article_1126286326864"">having a job offer makes getting a visa much easier</a>. You can get help with job placement and work visa application through organizations such as<a href=""http://www.worldteach.org/site/c.buLRIbNOIbJ2G/b.6150577/k.9B0A/Teach_Abroad_at_WorldTeach_teaching_volunteer_opportunities_worldwide.htm"">WorldTeach</a> and the <a href=""http://www.ciee.org/"">Council for International Educational Exchange</a>.</p><h3>Now pick a country</h3><p></p><p>Once youre fully prepared to start looking for overseas jobs teaching English, decide on a country and start looking for teaching jobs there. There are a number of third-party organizations that offer overseas English teaching programs.</p><p>""The benefits of working through a third-party program are that they find a pre-screened jobfor you, with a school that usually arranges your living situation,"" said<a href=""http://www.goabroad.com/teach-abroad"">Bridget Zapata from Go Abroad</a>. In addition, Zapata says these organizations generally take care of teach-abroad visas and other necessary documents. Unfortunately, these companies can also carry hefty fees, which can be a major downside.</p><p></p><p>If youre looking to save money and want to make your own arrangements for teaching English overseas, there are websites that can help you. Using job listing sites, such as <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/"">Simply Hired</a>, can be beneficial in searching for overseas teaching jobs. While a number of separate international job boards exist, Simply Hired has thousands of job listings in various categories internationally.</p><p>Doing a job search is the easy part.</p><p>Following through by contacting schools and/or employers is the difficult part. This is why research beforehand is crucial.</p><p></p><p>Of course, you can opt to directly contact schools and/or families seeking tutors, thus eliminating the need for third-party programs or hours of searching.</p><p>Whichever route you take, the key to searching for a job teaching English overseas is researching and planning with care. </p><p></p><p></p>"Interviews,How to Explain a Gap in Your Resume,"<h1><b>How to Explain a Gap in Your Resume</b></h1><p>Recruiters want to see evidence that you are a reliable individual who is capable of holding down a job. However, that doesn't mean that you are destined to never get a job if you have a gap in your resume. It is possible to overcome and even spin a period of unemployment in a positive way when trying to find a job.</p><h3>Don't try to hide it</h3><div><p>Do not attempt to cover up the period when you weren't working. Lying about dates of employment is a bad idea, as recruiting companies are likely to find out that you lied when they check your references. Some job seekers with long out-of-work periods are tempted to remove dates from their resume altogether, but this is also not a good strategy. According to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/jobs/28search.html"">Susan Ireland</a>, author of ""The Complete Idiots Guide to the Perfect Resume,"" recruiters often become suspicious when they receive a resume with no dates listed.</p></div><h3>Account for time out</h3><div><p>Being up front about gaps in your resume means that you have to explain them. Again, honesty is the best policy. If you took time away from work to take care of your family, you can list this in the personal section of your resume. Similarly, if you left the workforce to recover from an illness or injury, say you did so, but remember that you don't have to go into great detail about your health. The most important thing is not to leave time unaccounted for, as this can be a red flag to a potential employer.</p></div><h3>Accentuate the positive</h3><div><p>If you were engaged in volunteer work, training or consulting projects, then emphasize this productive use of time on your resume and during interviews. Be ready to talk about the experiences you had and the skills that you acquired during this period. Unpaid work can be listed on your resume under a general ""Experience"" heading, but keep in mind that some experts <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kristin-maschka/resume-advice-after-a-car_b_869488.html"">advise against using the term ""volunteer.""</a></p></div><h3>Talking about career gaps during interviews</h3><div><p>During the interview, be open and acknowledge the gap, but focus on communicating your enthusiasm to get back into steady employment. Explain how the skills you gained both before and during your career break are relevant to the role for which you are applying. Learn to tell the story of your period of unemployment as a positive time of self-development, rather than dwelling on the circumstances that kept you out of work.</p></div><h3>Keep a positive attitude</h3><div>Many people expect to struggle to find a job after a career break. As a result, they are discouraged before they even start their search, especially with a gap in their resume. Don't fall into this trap! Update your resume to reflect the experiences you've had since your last position, network with old contacts to find out about opportunities and approach your job search with a positive attitude. Resume gaps are overcome everyday by motivated individuals who have something to offer an employer.</div>"Interviews,10 Part Time Jobs That Pay Well,"<h1><b>Part-Time Jobs that Pay Well</b></h1><div>According to the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, approximately 7.9 million people work part-time because they either cannot find full-time employment or they had their work hours reduced against their wishes.
